Michael; Gordon, Jacques N.; Liang, Youguo; MacKinnon, Greg; Mansour, Asieh
In this article by the editors of this special issue, the authors discuss the changes being brought to real estate investment by new technology and how the other articles in the special issue nest into this broad theme. New technologies being applied specifically to property (proptech) are bringing changes to all aspects of commercial real estate, from construction to building management to investment to data collection. But, the authors argue, the greatest effect of new technology on commercial real estate investment will be from technology outside real estate and how it changes the way in which space is used by end users. Technology has already started to alter the way in which space is used and the types and locations of property being demanded. The authors argue that the ability to adopt technology into the investment process and adapt to how technology is changing the space market will be a key determinant of investment success in the future.</description><author>Clayton, Jim; Fabozzi, Frank J.; Giliberto, S.

Using performance data through the fourth quarter of 2017 on 467 funds that came to market between 2000 and 2013, the authors of this article first examine the unconditional performance of closed-end, private equity real estate (PERE) funds over time and across various fund characteristics. The performance metrics they use are the internal rate of return, the multiple on invested capital, and a proxy for the public market equivalent. Using conditional sorts, as well as regression procedures with asset pricing specifications, the authors estimate the exposure of PERE performance to fund-level characteristics and macroeconomic environment risk factors and find that both significantly affect PERE performance. More specifically, they find that PERE performance is positively related to fund size, gross domestic product growth changes, private market real estate returns, interest rate changes, and default spread changes and is negatively related to vintage volume. International funds dramatically underperformed relative to domestic funds during the sample period. The authors also find that fund performance is positively associated with the performance of prior funds raised by the same PERE firm.</description><author>Arnold, Thomas R.; Ling, David C.; Naranjo, Andy</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>AI and Machine Learning in Real Estate Investment</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Viriato, Jennifer Conway
The topic of artificial intelligence (AI) is seen frequently in popular media, academic journals, and corporate statements. However, real estate is an industry notoriously slow to adopt new technologies, and with new proptech (property technology) just beginning to open eyes to a whole new approach to investing, it is not yet clear where AI will have the most impact. Companies in the proptech space are beginning to use a variety of AI and machine learning (ML) techniques to enhance insights, productivity, and accuracy. The specific applications of these advancements and their transformative potential are explored in this article through in-depth conversations with technology investors, entrepreneurs, tech industry experts, and real estate professionals and are presented along with research on the latest literature and data on the companies and types of applications in this space. The current applications of AI and ML in real estate are broad and have important implications for how investors and other real estate professionals can incorporate technologies and new strategies into their decision making and operations.</description><author>Viriato, Jennifer Conway</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Default Prediction of Commercial Real Estate Properties Using Machine Learning Techniques</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Cowden, Chad; Fabozzi, Frank J.; Nazemi, Abdolreza
Academics and analysts have mostly employed stochastic and statistical default models to project defaults for properties backing commercial mortgage-backed securities. Although over the last few years there has been increased interest in using machine learning models to predict defaults on consumer loans, there has not been a comprehensive study that uses machine learning techniques to predict commercial real estate loan defaults. In this article, the authors investigate the use of machine learning techniques to predict defaults for commercial real estate property loans. The authors assess the performance of classification techniques based on machine learning (support vector machine, random forest, boosting, and classification tree) compared to the performance of the typical statistical technique. The principal findings of this study are that the support vector machine technique for predicting defaults on commercial property loans significantly outperforms other methods, and it has stable performance in imbalanced datasets. Moreover, the boosting technique identified the ratio of the capitalization rate spread to the average capitalization rate spread of property type as the most important driver of defaults in commercial real estate loans.</description><author>Cowden, Chad; Fabozzi, Frank J.; Nazemi, Abdolreza</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Multifamily Development: Can You Always Lease It Up?</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Fitzgerald, Mark; Zang, Chenchao; McIntosh, Will
Large institutional investors continue to view multifamily real estate favorably and raise their allocations to this sector. It is commonly perceived among institutional investors that multifamily- and multifamily development in particular-is a safer investment relative to other property sectors, a common refrain being "you can always lease it up." In this article, the authors attempt to validate this statement by examining the distribution of lease-up terms from initial lease-up to stabilization for multifamily developments delivered in the United States between 2008 and 2018. In addition, they investigate the impact of the length of the lease-up period on effective rents. Unfortunately, they do not have underwritten projections for each development to compare with subsequent performance as a mechanism to determine an investment's success. Despite this gap in the available data, the authors generally find support for the conventional wisdom; most developments are able to lease-up in a relatively expedient fashion, no matter the position in the economic/business cycle. However, effective rent change over the lease-up period varies significantly by point of cycle and lease-up term and is an important factor in the investment performance of multifamily developments.</description><author>Fitzgerald, Mark; Zang, Chenchao; McIntosh, Will</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Risk-Adjusted Attribution Analysis of Real Estate Portfolios</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Fisher, Jeffrey D.; D'Alessandro, Joseph
Comparing a fund or any portfolio's performance to a benchmark usually involves risk analysis and attribution analysis. Risk analysis considers measures such as beta and Jensen's alpha to determine if the portfolio is riskier than the benchmark. Attribution analysis decomposes the spread between the portfolio and the benchmark returns into components that are due to allocating the portfolio sector weights and selecting individual assets differently than the benchmark. These two types of analysis are typically done independently, with attribution analysis essentially assuming that there are no differences in risk between the portfolio and the benchmark. As a result, selection and allocation are applied to what is sometimes referred to as simple or nominal alpha, which is just the difference between the portfolio and benchmark return, ignoring risk. Some attempts have been made to combine the two, but none have done this in a way that is based on having attribution analysis apply to either Jensen's alpha (using beta as a risk adjustment) or Fama's beta, which relies only on relative standard deviations and adjusts for any additional risk resulting from not having a well-diversified portfolio. This article proposes a risk-adjusted performance attribution analysis that integrates risk measures with the Brinson models of attribution, which allows us to decompose the excess portfolio return into components of risk, allocation, selection, and net selectivity that is additive and consistent with financial theory. Risk-adjusted performance attribution can give us a quite different interpretation of which sectors contributed to better or worse performance relative to the benchmark. Traditional attribution analysis could result in a manager appearing to have done well in a sector where the higher return relative to the benchmark was due to taking on more risk. Alternatively, the manager could appear to have underperformed in a sector that was a less-risky sector. This is demonstrated using actual but masked open-end fund data as the manager portfolio compared to the NCREIF Property Index as the benchmark portfolio.</description><author>Fisher, Jeffrey D.; D'Alessandro, Joseph</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Another Look at Private Real Estate Returns by Strategy</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Bollinger, Mitchell A.; Pagliari, Joseph L.
This article examines the risk-adjusted, net-of-fee performance of noncore funds and generally finds that investors would have been better served by merely placing additional leverage on their core investments rather than investing in noncore assets. Using several datasets to create a mosaic-like view of the performance of private real estate investments, the authors find that over the 2000-2017 study period, value-added funds have, on average, generated an alpha of -3.26%; similarly, opportunistic funds have generated an alpha of -2.85%. Consequently, had investors in core funds used more leverage (loan-to-value ratios of 55% to 65%), they would have saved approximately $7.5 billion per year in unnecessary investment-management fees. The higher fees charged by these noncore funds were a material factor contributing to their negative alphas. Value-added funds charged approximately three times as much in fees as core funds, and opportunistic funds charged approximately four times as much. How and why these fee structures might change in the future is also explored. However, the fee differentials (relative to core funds) are insufficient to explain the entirety of the negative alpha associated with value-added and opportunistic investing. These conditions imply that noncore managers have, on average, overpaid for (and/or mismanaged) fund assets.</description><author>Bollinger, Mitchell A.; Pagliari, Joseph L.</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Environmental Performance of Commercial Real Estate: New Insights into Energy Efficiency Improvements</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Eichholtz, Piet; Holtermans, Rogier; Kok, Nils
This article provides new insights into the performance of commercial real estate, focusing on the environmental performance of institutional assets. The authors employ a proprietary dataset of energy consumption data that includes more than 26,000 buildings between 2009 and 2018. They document that, in their sample of commercial real estate, the median energy intensity decreased by more than 40% over the decade. Using a difference-in-difference analysis, the authors find that adoption of environmental building certification (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) is associated with significantly lower energy consumption and that there is substantial variation in these effects, depending on certification level and program, and label tenure. Moreover, specific interventions aimed at improving the energy efficiency of buildings considerably reduce ex post energy consumption, with effects varying based on local climatic conditions.</description><author>Eichholtz, Piet; Holtermans, Rogier; Kok, Nils</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Risk Reduction and Tracking Error in Small Commercial Real Estate Portfolios</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Reid, Bryan
Because of the extreme heterogeneity and lumpiness of commercial real estate, the topic of diversification and risk management has always attracted substantial interest, and a large body of work has been written on the subject. However, most of the analysis has focused on just a few markets, most notably the United Kingdom, or has been based on limited samples. This article uses asset-level data from over 9,000 office assets in the MSCI Global Annual Property Index to explore the performance of small portfolios (1 to 30 assets) over two separate five-year periods (20072011 and 2013-2017) in 16 national markets. The analysis focuses on small portfolios of fewer than 30 assets because many investors (even institutional investors and funds) have portfolios that are relatively small in terms of number of assets. The results provide a globally consistent overview of how asset correlations and market risk affected small commercial real estate portfolios and may have implications for the way investors and managers think about diversification in their exposures.</description><author>Reid, Bryan</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Real Estate in Mixed-Asset Portfolios for Various Investment Horizons</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Delfim, Jean-Christophe; Hoesli, Martin
In this article, the authors investigate the role of real estate in a mixed-asset portfolio for various investment horizons and notably extend the literature by considering together direct real estate, real estate investment trusts (REITs), and nonlisted real estate funds, as well as other alternative investments. Using US data spanning almost three decades, they report that medium-to long-term investors should allocate 10% to 20% of their portfolio to direct real estate. In contrast, short-term investors should focus on open-end core funds, which are found to be good substitutes for direct investments. REITs are usually of limited interest as a substitute for direct real estate, but they could be used in conjunction with direct investments for medium-and long-term horizons. Value-added and opportunistic closed-end funds are found to be imperfect substitutes for direct investments and are only marginally used. Finally, the authors find that including commodities, private equity, and hedge funds in a portfolio enhances the portfolio's performance but the allocation to real estate barely changes.</description><author>Delfim, Jean-Christophe; Hoesli, Martin</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Do Taxes Matter to Foreign Real Estate Investors? Evidence from FIRPTA Reform</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Howard, Margot; Pancak, Katherine A.
There is little research on whether foreign real estate investors respond to domestic taxes, which is somewhat ironic given that real estate is such a tax-driven industry. This article investigates the impact of taxes on foreign investment in real estate by exploring the response to 2015 reforms to the Foreign Investment in Real Property Tax Act of 1980, a unique section of the US Internal Revenue Code that imposes real estate income and capital gains withholding taxes on foreign investors. The new law exempts qualified foreign pension funds, with the effect of reducing capital gains withholding taxes by up to 35% depending on investor position and home country tax treaties. The authors find that this reform led to a five to seven percentage point increase in annual investment growth from pension funds in countries that experienced a tax rate decrease, relative to general trends in foreign pension fund investment in US real estate investment trusts. In addition, the results suggest that pension funds in those countries responded almost immediately.</description><author>Howard, Margot; Pancak, Katherine A.</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Quantitative Special Issue INTRODUCTION</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Fabozzi, Frank J.

In this article, the authors posit a quid pro quo in economic benefits between sell-side equity analysts and large hedge fund managers. They show that large hedge funds opportunistically trade one to four days prior to the publication of a recommendation change, a finding consistent with flow of information from analysts to hedge funds. Next, the authors demonstrate that in return for the information provided, analysts benefit from (1) better external evaluations and (2) higher trading commissions and fees for their brokerage firm. Notably, pre-trading occurs only when the analyst issuing the recommendations has a high external evaluation and the analyst's brokerage house is a prime broker to the hedge fund.</description><author>Klein, April; Saunders, Anthony; Wong, Yu Ting Forester</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Sep 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>The Price/Earnings Ratio, Growth, and Interest Rates: The Smartest BET</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Estep, Preston W.
The price/earnings ratio (PE) is the most ubiquitous measure of investment value. It appears to tell us how many years would be required for accumulated earnings to equal today's price (the break-even time [BET]), but that interpretation is built on unrealistic assumptions about a company's future: Earnings do not grow, or if they do grow, they are discounted at a rate equal to their growth. This article shows a simple formula that yields a correct computation of BET. A correct BET remedies the failings of PE, allowing valuation comparisons of stocks with widely different growth rates and PEs. Moreover, it provides useful information about the sensitivity of today's price to changes in interest rates or growth rates. BET is shown to be superior not only to simple PE but also to the ratio of PE to growth rate.</description><author>Estep, Preston W.</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Sep 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>On the Existence of Stock Price Bubbles-The Smoking Gun- Discounts and Premiums on Closed-End Funds and ETFs</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Jarrow, Robert
It is continually debated in the academic and professional literature whether stock prices exhibit or have exhibited bubbles. In this article the author argues that the persistence of closed-end fund (CEF) and exchange-traded fund (ETF) discounts and premiums, a phenomenon believed to be inexplicable by rational asset pricing theory, is due to the existence of stock price bubbles. Price bubbles in the stocks underlying the funds and in the market prices of the fund shares themselves generate the discounts and premiums. This rational asset pricing theory that explains the persistent of these discounts and premiums on CEFs and ETFs across both time and varying market conditions represents the proverbial smoking gun proving the existence of stock price bubbles.</description><author>Jarrow, Robert</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Sep 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Portfolio Selection: A Game-Theoretic Approach</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Simonian, Joseph
Game-theoretic methods are not widespread in finance. One reason is that practitioners do not see straightforward applications of game theory to core investment problems. To that end, in this article the author describes two novel portfolio construction applications of the game-theoretic solution concept known as the Shapley value. In the first, the Shapley value is used as a type of shrinkage operator to blend the allocation weights generated by two different portfolio selection frameworks. In the second, the Shapley value is used to build a unique approach to portfolio selection using what the author calls an optimization game. In both applications, asset classes are assumed to be the players who are bargaining over representation in a portfolio. As the article shows, the Shapley value naturally facilitates the construction of well-diversified portfolios that can satisfy specific investor goals without the need for additional formal constraints.</description><author>Simonian, Joseph</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Sep 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>International Equity Investing: Is Flexibility the New Diversification?</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Ramkumar, Sunder R.; Black, Michelle J.; Fu, Vincent C.
Global cross-country correlations have increased significantly across asset classes over the last two decades. This article documents systematic links between correlations of capital markets and the globalization of the real economy that suggest that higher correlations will persist and challenge the traditional role of international equities as a domestic diversifier. The authors argue that the case for international investing increasingly rests on the return potential from investing in a broad set of companies and that flexibility to invest across borders is key to capturing this value. They test this thesis with an empirical analysis of mutual funds and find that strategies with fewer geographical restrictions have indeed generated superior returns. The authors find benefits of flexibility in US funds that invest internationally, international funds that invest in the United States, international funds that invest in emerging markets and in global funds. Their results hold consistently in the ex post analysis of average and top-quartile strategies and when they use simple screens to identify and evaluate skillful managers. Interestingly, the authors find that improved results are driven by superior stock selection, as opposed to systematic regional tilts or market timing.</description><author>Ramkumar, Sunder R.; Black, Michelle J.; Fu, Vincent C.</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Sep 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>The Alpha, Beta, and Sigma of ESG: Better Beta, Additional Alpha?</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Jacobsen, Brian; Lee, Wai; Ma, Chao
Rather than treat investments as statistical objects to be optimally combined into portfolios, investors are increasingly interested in the environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) dimensions of their investments. Analysts traditionally evaluated these dimensions in qualitative ways, but many data providers are attempting to score these dimensions, effectively quantifying what was qualitative. For developed market equities, on the basis of one popular data provider's ESG assessment, we evaluate the evidence on whether portfolios of highly rated ESG stocks are materially different from their complements (non-ESG stocks) in their investment opportunity sets. It is obvious that ESG stocks dyer from non-ESG stocks in their ESG dimensions, but we show that ESG stocks returns are also different. Although the total return-to-total risk of ESG stocks may be lower than that for non-ESG stocks, after factor-adjusting the returns and risks, portfolios of ESG stocks with positive alpha have return-to-risk features comparable to those of portfolios of non-ESG stocks with positive alpha. For portfolios without statistically significant alpha, the portfolios of ESG stocks have lower residual volatility than portfolios of non-ESG stocks. It should be possible, by factor-neutralizing portfolios, to build better beta with comparable alpha portfolios by using ESG factors.</description><author>Jacobsen, Brian; Lee, Wai; Ma, Chao</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Sep 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Integrating Factors in Market Indexes and Active Portfolios</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Melas, Dimitris; Nagy, Zoltan; Kumar, Navneet; Zangari, Peter
In this article, the authors review factor performance in global equity markets using coherent data and methodology and apply a new template to evaluate their backtests for potential selection bias under multiple testing. They then propose a systematic process for integrating factor information into different investment strategies. The authors show that this process is consistent with the Black-Litterman framework and test it on a sample of market indexes and active equity portfolios. Integrating factors in indexes improved risk-adjusted performance while retaining high liquidity and capacity. Adding factors to active strategies enhanced information ratios while maintaining the portfolio characteristics and stock selection alpha of the original strategies. The authors' analysis may have important implications for different types of investors. Asset owners may be able to tilt reference indexes toward rewarded factors without sacrificing market coverage and diversification. Index managers can track factor-tilted indexes because they remain investable and replicable. Finally, active managers may be able to incorporate factor information into their strategies to harvest factor premiums while preserving their core investment process and the added value from fundamental security selection.</description><author>Melas, Dimitris; Nagy, Zoltan; Kumar, Navneet; Zangari, Peter</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Sep 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>The Capacity of Factor Strategies</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Blitz, David; Marchesini, Thom
The rapidly growing popularity of factor investing raises questions about the capacity of factor-based strategies. In this article, the authors show that widely used factor indexes face severe capacity constraints as a result of concentrating all their trades on just a handful of rebalancing moments each year. They argue that the key to unlocking a high capacity is efficiently using the liquidity offered by the market throughout the year. This is illustrated with a simulation experiment in which the trades of standard factor indexes are simply spread over a longer period. Although this naive approach uses stale information, no loss in performance is observed and trade feasibility, and hence capacity, show spectacular improvement.</description><author>Blitz, David; Marchesini, Thom</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Sep 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Macroeconomic Risks in Equity Factor Investing</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Amenc, Noel; Esakia, Mikheil; Goltz, Felix; Luyten, Ben
There is a consensus that equity factors are cyclical and depend on macroeconomic conditions. To build well-diversified portfolios of factors, one needs to account for the fact that different factors may have similar dependencies on macroeconomic conditions. The authors provide a protocol for selecting relevant macroeconomic state variables that reflect changes in expectations about the aggregate economy. They show that returns of standard equity factors depend significantly on such state variables. Factor returns also depend on aggregate macroeconomic regimes reflecting good and bad times. These macroeconomic risks have strong portfolio implications. For example, some equity factors depend on interest rate risk. Investors who already have exposure to this risk through bond investments may increase loss risk when tilting to the wrong equity factors. The authors also show that standard multifactor allocations do not sufficiently address macroeconomic conditionality. Combining factors may not reduce macroeconomic risks even for factors with low correlation. Understanding macroeconomic risks is a prerequisite both for risk transparency and for improving diversification of equity factor investments.</description><author>Amenc, Noel; Esakia, Mikheil; Goltz, Felix; Luyten, Ben</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Sep 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>The Size Effect Is Alive and Well, and Hiding behind Calendar Anomalies</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Aharon, David Yechiam; Qadan, Mahmoud
Empirical evidence from the literature documents that the size effect has gradually diminished since the early 1980s. In this article, the authors examine the stability of this anomaly between 1926 and 2014. The evidence they document indicates a substantial presence of the size effect across various calendar anomalies. The anomalies considered are the January effect, the Halloween effect, the Mark Twain effect, the other January effect, the seasonal affective disorder effect, and the turn-of-the-month, day-of-the-week, and week-of-the-year effects. Their findings hold true for different sample periods, various modeling specifications, and types of returns and may provide investment professionals such as portfolio managers, investment officers, analysts, and other market participants with a practical tool for their daily decision-making.</description><author>Aharon, David Yechiam; Qadan, Mahmoud</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Sep 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Bond-Market Risk Factors and Manager Performance</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Mladina, Peter; Germani, Steven
The authors introduce a novel approach for jointly testing bond-market factor models and bond manager performance using the attributes of market efficiency as an ideal, or benchmark. In addition to proposing enhanced constructions of term and default factors, they find evidence for a prepayment risk factor. They also find that style premiums do not materially reduce alphas or explain much additional common variation in the returns of traded bond portfolios when they are added to term, default, and prepayment risk factors. A factor model with just term, default, and prepayment risk factors performs as well, but is more parsimonious and employs clear sources of systematic risk. The authors find evidence of factor-adjusted alpha in a very small subset of active bond managers.</description><author>Mladina, Peter; Germani, Steven</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Sep 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>The Best of Strategies for the Worst of Times: Can Portfolios Be Crisis Proofed?</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Harvey, Campbell R.; Hoyle, Edward; Rattray, Sandy; Sargaison, Matthew; Taylor, Dan; Van Hemert, Otto
In the late stages of long bull markets, a popular question arises: What steps can an investor take to mitigate the impact of the inevitable large equity correction? Hedging equity portfolios is notoriously difficult and expensive. In this article, the authors analyze the performance of different tools that investors could deploy. For example, continuously holding short-dated S&amp;P 500 put options is the most reliable defensive method but also the most costly strategy. Holding safe-haven US Treasury bonds produces a positive carry but may be an unreliable crisis-hedge strategy because the post-2000 negative bond-equity correlation is a historical rarity. Long gold and long credit protection portfolios sit between puts and bonds in terms of both cost and reliability. Dynamic strategies that performed well during past drawdowns include futures time-series momentum (which benefits from extended equity sell-offs) and a quality strategy that takes long (short) positions in the highest (lowest) quality company stocks (which benefits from a flight-to-quality effect during crises). The authors examine both large equity drawdowns and recessions. They also provide some out-of-sample evidence of the defensive performance of these strategies relative to an earlier, related article.</description><author>Harvey, Campbell R.; Hoyle, Edward; Rattray, Sandy; Sargaison, Matthew; Taylor, Dan; Van Hemert, Otto</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jul 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Risk and Reward in the Orphan Drug Industry</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Lo, Andrew W.; Thakor, Richard T.
Thanks to a combination of scientific advances and economic incentives, the development of therapeutics to treat rare or orphan diseases has grown dramatically in recent years. With the advent of Food and Drug Administration-approved gene therapies and the promise of gene editing, many experts believe we are at an inflection point in dealing with these afflictions. In this article, the authors propose to document this inflection point by measuring the risk and reward of investing in the orphan drug industry. They construct a stock market index of 39 publicly traded companies that specialize in developing drugs for orphan diseases and compare the financial performance of this index, which they call ORF, to the broader biopharmaceutical industry and the overall stock market from 2000 to 2015. Although the authors report that ORF underperformed other bio-pharma companies and the overall stock market in the early 2000s, its performance has improved over time: from 2010 to 2015, ORF returned 608%, far exceeding the 317%, 320%, and 305% returns of the S&amp;P, NASDAQ, and NYSE ARCA Bio-tech indexes, respectively, and the 83% of the S&amp;P 500. ORF does have higher volatility than the other indexes but still outperforms even on a risk-adjusted basis, with a Sharpe ratio of 1.24 versus Sharpe ratios of 1.17, 1.14, and 1.05, respectively, for the other three biotech indexes and 0.71 for the S&amp;P 500. However, ORF has a market beta of 1.16, which suggests significant correlation to the aggregate stock market and less diversification benefits than traditional pharmaceutical investments.</description><author>Lo, Andrew W.; Thakor, Richard T.</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jul 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Crowded Trades: Implications for Sector Rotation and Factor Timing</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Kinlaw, William; Kritzman, Mark; Turkington, David
Crowded trades are often associated with bubbles. If investors can locate a bubble sufficiently early, they can profit from the run-up in prices. But to profit from a bubble, investors must exit the bubble before the sell-off erodes all of the profits. The authors propose two measures for managing exposure to bubbles. One measure, called asset centrality, locates crowded trading, which they show is often associated with the formation of bubbles. The other is a measure of relative value, which helps to separate crowding that occurs during a bubble's run-up from crowding that occurs during a bubble's sell-off. Neither measure by itself is sufficient for identifying the full cycle of a bubble, but the authors show that together these measures have the potential to locate bubbles in sectors and in factors as they begin to emerge and to identify exit points before they fully deflate.</description><author>Kinlaw, William; Kritzman, Mark; Turkington, David</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jul 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>The Size Premium in Equity Markets: Where Is the Risk?</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Ciliberti, Stefano; Serie, Emmanuel; Simon, Guillaume; Lemperiere, Yves; Bouchaud, Jean-Philippe
The authors find that when measured in terms of dollar-turnover, and once beta and low volatility (low-vol) is neutralized, the size effect is alive and well. With a long-term t-statistic of 5.1, the cold-minus-hot (CMH) anomaly is certainly not less significant than other well-known factors such as value or quality. As compared to market-cap-based SMB, the authors report that CMH portfolios are much less anti-correlated to the low-vol anomaly. In contrast with standard risk premiums, size-based portfolios are found by the authors to be virtually unskewed. In fact, they report that the extreme risk of these portfolios is dominated by the large-cap leg; small caps actually have a positive (rather than negative) skewness. The only argument that the authors find favors a risk premium interpretation at the individual stock level is that the extreme drawdowns are more frequent for small-cap/turnover stocks, even after accounting for volatility. According to the authors, however, this idiosyncratic risk is clearly diversifiable and should not, in theory, generate higher returns.</description><author>Ciliberti, Stefano; Serie, Emmanuel; Simon, Guillaume; Lemperiere, Yves; Bouchaud, Jean-Philippe</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jul 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Foundations of ESG Investing: How ESG Affects Equity Valuation, Risk, and Performance</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Giese, Guido; Lee, Linda-Eling; Melas, Dimitris; Nagy, Zoltan; Nishikawa, Laura
Many studies have focused on the relationship between companies with strong environmental, social, and governance (ESG) characteristics and corporate financial performance. However, these have often struggled to show that positive correlations-when produced-can in fact explain the behavior. The authors of this article provide a link between ESG information and the valuation and performance of companies, by examining three transmission channels within a standard discounted cash flow model-which they call the cash-flow channel, the idiosyncratic risk channel, and the valuation channel. They tested each of these transmission channels using Morgan Stanley Capital International ESG Ratings data and financial variables. This showed that companies' ESG information was transmitted to their valuation and performance, both through their systematic risk profile (lower costs of capital and higher valuations) and their idiosyncratic risk profile (higher profitability and lower exposures to tail risk). The research suggests that changes in a company's ESG characteristics may be a useful financial indicator. ESG ratings may also be suitable for integration into policy benchmarks and financial analyses.</description><author>Giese, Guido; Lee, Linda-Eling; Melas, Dimitris; Nagy, Zoltan; Nishikawa, Laura</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jul 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>And the Winner Is...

The authors evaluate and compare the usefulness of various valuation ratios for equity country allocation. To this end, the performance of 73 national equity indexes is investigated for the period 1996 to 2017. The earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) to- enterprise value (EV) multiple is the best predictor of performance and outperforms other metrics. An equal-weighted portfolio that is long (short) in the tertile of countries with the highest (lowest) EBITDA-to-EV ratio produces a mean monthly return of 0.69% and a Sharpe ratio of 0.81, which is more than double the Sharpe ratios obtained from using traditional metrics such as the book-to-market ratio or dividend yield. Two major drawbacks of intercountry value strategies are identified: (1) pay-offs are derived predominantly from emerging and frontier markets and (2) profitability has significantly declined in the last decade.</description><author>Zaremba, Adam; Szczygielski, Jan Jakub</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jul 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Protecting the Downside of Trend When It Is Not Your Friend</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Yang, Kun; Qian, Edward; Belton, Bryan
Simple trend-following strategies have been documented as cost-effective, transparent alternatives to the hedge-fund style managed futures strategies. Although largely capturing the returns of the managed futures industry, those simple strategies may periodically suffer significant losses due to oversimplified trend signals and underdiversified portfolio construction. In this article, the authors show that trend-following strategies with moderate sophistication and better diversification can significantly reduce the downside risk of simple trend-following strategies without sacrificing much upside potential. The authors therefore recommend that investors who seek the benefits of cost-effective trend-following strategies consider adding reasonable complexity to the strategies.</description><author>Yang, Kun; Qian, Edward; Belton, Bryan</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jul 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Valuation Bias and Limits to Nudges</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Shefrin, Hersh
Because of limits to arbitrage, it is reasonable for sell-side analysts' target prices to deviate from their corresponding estimates of future fundamental value. Although this inequality does not imply that sell-side analysts should provide biased estimates of fundamental value, many do. According to the author, a key contributor to this bias is making an unwarranted assumption that in the long run firms can be expected to earn more than their cost of capital. Biased estimates of fundamental value can harm long-term investors. At the same time, the author explains in this article that there are simple nudges that can help avoid the bias. Nevertheless, limits to nudges associated with buy-side catering prevent their application. The magnitude of the associated bias can be substantial for the stocks of large firms that dominate the market. Notably, sell-side analysts' upwardly biased estimated fundamental values for these stocks lie in the vicinity of consensus target prices and market prices. According to the author, this suggests that valuation bias associated with stocks of large firms that dominate the market is consistent with intermittent overvaluation of these stocks and the overall market.</description><author>Shefrin, Hersh</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jul 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Accelerating Learning in Active Management: The Alpha-Brier Process</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Cerniglia, Joseph A.; Tetlock, Philip E.
Forecasting tournaments have shown it is possible to improve the accuracy of forecasts of real-world events that sophisticated observers often supposed are too idiosyncratic to be pinned down by numerical probabilities. Building on this research program, the authors propose the Alpha-Brier process to help firms improve forecasts guiding investment decisions. Alpha-Brier offers four major benefits: (1) It reduces the noisiness of vague-verbiage forecasts, such as X "might" or "could" happen, that are open to varying interpretations; (2) it makes it easier to distinguish skill from luck as drivers of portfolio performance; (3) it gives investors faster feedback on the accuracy of their probability judgments; and (4) it lets managers test which methods of training, incentivizing, and aggregating judgments deliver the biggest boosts to accuracy. Paradoxically, the more pervasive the skepticism toward the core premise of Alpha-Brier that probability judgments can be extended to superficially unique events, the more opportunities there will be for firms to exploit market inefficiencies linked to overreliance on vague-verbiage forecasts.</description><author>Cerniglia, Joseph A.; Tetlock, Philip E.</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jul 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>"Flexicure" Retirement Solutions: A Part of the Answer to the Pension Crisis?</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Martellini, Lionel; Milhau, Vincent; Mulvey, John
Individuals preparing for retirement are currently left with an unsatisfactory choice between security with no flexibility with annuity products and flexibility without security with investment products such as balanced funds or target date funds. To get out of this impasse, the authors introduce a range of flexicure retirement goal-based investing strategies that offer both security and flexibility with respect to the objective of generating replacement income in decumulation. Recent advances in financial engineering and digital technologies make it possible to apply goal-based investing principles to a much broader population of investors than the few traditional clients who can afford customized mandates or private banking services, which suggests that these flexicure retirement solutions can be used as part of the solution to the global pension crisis.</description><author>Martellini, Lionel; Milhau, Vincent; Mulvey, John</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jul 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Scaling and Adaptive Asset Allocation</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Wilcox, Jarrod

"Upside participation and downside protection" is a popular motto for many investors. It has taken on much more significance in recent years, in the wake of the global financial crisis. But how do we define and evaluate strategies from the perspective of "upside participation and downside protection"? In this article, the authors present an analytic framework in which they provide a quantitative definition of upside and downside participation ratio, define participation ratio difference as a goodness measure for defensive strategies, and prove a relationship between the participation ratio difference and traditional alpha. As an illustration, they apply this new analysis to the S&amp;P 500 Index and its 10 sectors and show that defensive, low-beta sectors tend to have positive participation ratio differences, while cyclical, high-beta sectors tend to have negative participation ratio differences. This finding is consistent with the low-beta/volatility anomaly and provides another explanation for the popularity of low-beta/volatility strategies.</description><author>Qian, Edward</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2015 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>The Resale Value of Risk-Parity Equity Portfolios</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Sorensen, Eric H.; Alonso, Nicholas F.
This article examines the application of risk parity to fully diversify an equity portfolio. It presents wealth accumulation in a stochastic dominance framework, tested over increasing investment horizons. The portfolio construction algorithms consider sector, country, and stocks in achieving an alternative to capitalization-weighted approaches. Risk parity is dominant over 75% of the historical periods for any two-year horizon and is dominant in all cases after six-year horizons. It achieves dominance over capitalization-weighted indices over shorter horizons during periods of higher market volatility, periods of higher inflation, and periods with steep yield curves.</description><author>Sorensen, Eric H.; Alonso, Nicholas F.</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2015 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>A Penalty Cost Approach to Strategic Asset Allocation with Illiquid Asset Classes</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Hayes, Mark; Primbs, James A.; Chiquoine, Ben
Traditional approaches to asset allocation do not directly address the issue of liquidity. The financial crisis brought liquidity management to the forefront for several large university endowments investors who heretofore had been considered thought leaders in their approaches to asset allocation. The authors discuss a new approach developed at Stanford University that modifies the familiar mean variance optimization framework by incorporating an illiquidity-related marginal penalty function that varies with each investor's liquidity needs. The new methodology allows for an explicit, easily communicated, and natural specification of illiquidity preferences that works in conjunction with the standard Markowitz approach to solve the asset-allocation problem faced by today's institutional investors.</description><author>Hayes, Mark; Primbs, James A.; Chiquoine, Ben</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2015 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>A Conclusion for Most CEOs: Your Corporation Should Not Pay Dividends</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Bierman, Harold

In his previous articles, however, the author notes that he failed to take into account the possibility that corporations, in the present tax environment, should normally pay zero dividends. In this article, the author concludes that corporations should normally pay zero cash dividends, unless their stockholders do not pay income taxes.</description><author>Bierman, Harold</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2015 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Market Transparency and the Marking Precision of Bond Mutual Fund Managers</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Cici, Gjergji; Gibson, Scott; Gunduz, Yalin; Merrick, John J.
The validity of the price marks placed on bonds for valuation purposes is important for a diverse group of stakeholders, including investors, mutual fund managers, dealers, pricing services, and financial regulators. The authors analyze the dispersion of month-end price marks simultaneously placed on identical corporate bonds by different U.S. mutual fund managers, before and after TRACE dissemination and issuer introductions into Markit's Credit Default Swap spread database. The authors find large and statistically significant decreases in newly disseminated bonds around key TRACE system rollout events. Dispersion for large, investment-grade bonds fell 20% to 83% after the start of TRACE reporting. They also find evidence of spillover effects for non-disseminated bonds. During the pre-TRACE period, some evidence that mark dispersion fell for investment-grade issuers after introductions into Markit's database is reported. The results provide support for the idea that the TRACE transparency initiative reduced information inequality within the market's institutional side. The original NASD concern about people "operating largely in the dark" effectively applied to professional fund managers.</description><author>Cici, Gjergji; Gibson, Scott; Gunduz, Yalin; Merrick, John J.</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2015 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>A Liquidity Program to Stabilize Equity Markets</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Alan, Nazli Sila; Mask, John S.; Schwartz, Robert A.
The authors consider a program that, by bringing additional liquidity to the equity markets, would benefit market participants, listed companies, an exchange, and the broader economy. Established by an issuer, managed by a third-party, broker-dealer intermediary, formally structured and maximally transparent, the program involves corporate share repurchase in a falling market and issuance in a rising market. Simulation analysis is used to assess the procedure for 30 DOW and 30 DAX stocks over the five-year span of 2008 to 2012. Their findings indicate that the program can generate profits for firms that institute it. The authors suggest that additional steps be taken to refine, further test, and implement the procedure.</description><author>Alan, Nazli Sila; Mask, John S.; Schwartz, Robert A.</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2015 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>What's in the News? Using News Sentiment Momentum for Tactical Asset Allocation</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Uhl, Matthias W.; Pedersen, Mads; Malitius, Oliver
News and news sentiment often influence financial markets and asset prices. Investors commonly recognize this, but only a few studies have used news sentiment in news to predict future financial market developments and to formulate alpha-generating strategies, let alone create a best-practice approach for tactical asset allocation. In order to fill this gap, the authors combine company- and macro-specific news sentiment from around 100,000 news pieces per week and use the CUSUM (cumulative sum) filter method to calculate momentum in news sentiment. With this approach, they obtain a strategy that delivers solid outperformance with an information ratio of 0.8, while switching as few as eight times per year (on average), making it practicable for both tactical asset allocators and investors in general.</description><author>Uhl, Matthias W.; Pedersen, Mads; Malitius, Oliver</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2015 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>How Much Error Is in the Tracking Error? The Impact of Estimation Risk on Fund Tracking Error</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Woodgate, Artemiza; Siegel, Andrew F.
The authors explain optimized portfolios' poor out-of-sample performance (to minimize tracking error relative to a given benchmark, while achieving a specified expected excess return) in the presence of estimation error in the underlying asset means and covariances. The theoretical bias adjustments for this estimation risk developed by the authors involves taking mathematical expectations of asymptotically expanded future returns of portfolios formed with estimated weights. They provide closed-form adjustments for estimates of the expectation and standard deviation of the portfolio's excess returns. The adjustments significantly reduce bias in global equity portfolios, reduce the costs of rebalancing portfolios, and are robust to sample size and non-normality. By using these approximation methods before investing, it may be possible to assess the effect of statistical estimation error on tracking-error-optimized portfolio performance.</description><author>Woodgate, Artemiza; Siegel, Andrew F.</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2015 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Smart Beta: The Owner's Manual</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Kahn, Ronald N.; Lemmon, Michael
Smart-beta products have captured the interest of investors. But where do they fit in their portfolios? The typical investor, who currently owns active and index products, should own active, index, and smart-beta products. This article introduces a framework that decomposes any strategy's return over time into a broad capitalization-weighted index return, the return to static exposures to smart-beta factors, the return to timing smart-beta factors, and the return above and beyond smart beta. Smart-beta risk constitutes roughly one-third of the active risk of an average active equity manager, and roughly two-thirds of the active risk of an average fixed-income manager. Diversifying across active managers increases the fraction in smart beta. Most investors will want all of these return sources in their portfolio, and this framework facilitates optimizing the blend.</description><author>Kahn, Ronald N.; Lemmon, Michael</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2015 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Extreme Correlations and Optimizing for Stress</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Phoa, Wesley
Asset correlations often change significantly during periods of financial market dislocation.

This lets investors apply standard mean variance techniques to analyze investment strategy under extreme conditions. Applications include risk management and constructing optimally defensive portfolios for stressed markets. The method is based on recent advances in multivariate extreme-value theory.</description><author>Phoa, Wesley</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2015 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Inflation-Protecting Asset Allocation: A Downside Risk Analysis</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Koniarski, Tim; Sebastian, Steffen
This article studies the inflation-protection qualities of cash, bonds, stocks, and direct real estate, and the optimal inflation-protecting asset allocations within a downside risk framework. Using a value-at-risk model to capture predictable price dynamics, the authors find that the inflation-hedging properties of assets substantially change over the investment horizon. Cash is clearly the best hedge against inflation in the short run. However, as the investment horizon increases, bonds, stocks, and real estate become the more attractive options, with real estate exhibiting the best inflation-protection qualities on a medium- and long-term basis. While cash plays the most important role in short-term portfolios, the weights of the inflation-protecting portfolios shift to real estate, stocks, and bonds as the investment horizon increases.</description><author>Koniarski, Tim; Sebastian, Steffen</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2015 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Risk Parity Optimality</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Fisher, Gregg S.; Maymin, Philip Z.; Maymin, Zakhar G.
In this article, the authors show under general conditions that the probability of risk parity beating any other portfolio is more than 50%. They also prove the maximin properties of a risk-parity portfolio under two scenarios: 1) when all assets' future Sharpe ratios are greater than some positive unknown constant and all correlations are less than another unknown constant, or 2) when the sum of all assets' future Sharpe ratios is greater than some unknown constant. In each case, the authors show that risk parity is the unique maximin portfolio. Finally, the authors empirically confirm their theoretical results for the two main asset classes.</description><author>Fisher, Gregg S.; Maymin, Philip Z.; Maymin, Zakhar G.</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2015 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Economics: An Empirical Science Capable of Forecasting Economic Events?</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Focardi, Sergio M.; Fabozzi, Frank J.

Commercial buildings represent a significant share of global energy consumption. In the general absence of regulation, voluntary labeling and green building certification schemes have been introduced to reflect this externality to building owners and tenants. The implications of such schemes have previously been documented to affect building financial performance. However, existing studies have focused mostly on the U.S. market and, more importantly, generally include only a limited set of performance metrics. Using a rich, proprietary dataset from one of the largest building owners/managers in North America, the authors investigate the effects of green building certification on non-financial metrics, such as tenant satisfaction, incentives, and lease renewal. Their empirical results show that buildings certified through voluntary labeling schemes generally have a higher probability of lease renewal, offer lower incentives, and have more satisfied tenants They then study the effects of green building certification on financial metrics, such as rents and occupancy levels. The findings for the U.S. sample unambiguously confirm previously documented results-LEED and ENERGY STAR certified buildings command a small rent premium and have a lower vacancy risk. For Canada, the effects for LEED certified buildings are consistent with U.S. results. The results show that the national green building scheme is not priced in, but that these buildings still offer greater overall stability versus non-certified buildings through increased releasing rates, lower incentives, and substantially higher tenant satisfaction levels. The findings reported in this article provide an important contribution to the understanding of underlying value drivers in more efficient, sustainable buildings and offer some first evidence for the international validity of otherwise mostly U.S.-based studies on the financial performance of more efficient, "green" commercial buildings.</description><author>Devine, Avis; Kok, Nils</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Sep 2015 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>THE VOLATILITY OF REAL ESTATE MARKETS: A Decomposition</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Wheaton, William C.
The research reported in this article examines how the volatility of real estate markets can be exactly decomposed into supply-side and demand-side factors that add up. What allows this is measuring volatility with vacancy, rather than examining rents, income, or investment return. In this decomposition, the role of supply depends keenly on its timing relative to demand side shocks. When the correlation between the two sides of the market is sufficiently positive, supply can help to reduce market volatility. Negative correlations imply that supply always contributes to market volatility. Empirically, the author compares the overall volatility of 50 metropolitan markets, across several property types (offices, apartments, industrial, and hotels) and finds very different decompositions across the types. With these decompositions, the author tries to characterize those kinds of markets (geographically within each type of property) whose volatility is driven more by demand rather than by supply factors.</description><author>Wheaton, William C.</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Sep 2015 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>WHAT'S IN A LOAN YIELD? The Construction of a Hedonic Index of Yields for Commercial Real Estate Mortgages</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Chervachidze, Serguei; Gallagher, Mark; Wheaton, William C.
In this article, the authors investigate the utility of using a hedonic model in constructing an index of yields on commercial mortgage loans. They use a large unique proprietary dataset of mortgage originations from 2000Q3-2012Q4 to construct a hedonic model of yields as a function of loan characteristics as well as time effects. The authors then use the hedonic model to construct a constant-quality index of mortgage yields and test whether the index performs better in uncovering underlying equilibrium relationships with other economy-wide yield variables than a simple average of yields. They find evidence that is strongly in favor of a hedonic index. Finally, the authors build a forecasting model of the hedonic index as a function of a widely available index of corporate bond yields and test the forecasting performance of the model. The major finding is that the index works well in a forecasting model and lends itself readily to forecasting applications.</description><author>Chervachidze, Serguei; Gallagher, Mark; Wheaton, William C.</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Sep 2015 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>THE POST-CRISIS CMBS MARKET: Will Regulations Prevent Another Market Meltdown?</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Fabozzi, Frank J.; Mcbride, Joe; Clancy, Manus
In this article, the authors discuss the importance and development of the commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) market. They then review several issues that will play an important role in fostering recovery of the CMBS market or impeding the CMBS markets or particular segments within that market: (1) the risk-retention rule applicable to commercial real estate loans and CMBS under the Dodd Frank Act, (2) the U.S. federal banking regulators' adoption of the U.S. Basel III rule, and (3) federal government participation in the reinsurance market for terrorist insurance.</description><author>Fabozzi, Frank J.; Mcbride, Joe; Clancy, Manus</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Sep 2015 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>DO PUBLIC REAL ESTATE RETURNS REALLY LEAD PRIVATE RETURNS?</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Hoesli, Martin; Oikarinen, Elias; Serrano, Camilo
In this article, the authors use sector-level unlevered real estate investment trust (REIT) and direct real estate data to study whether the "escrow lag" in the recording of private market prices could explain the observed lead lag relationship between REITs and direct real estate markets. They find evidence of REIT returns leading private returns in the office and retail sectors even after catering for a 90-day escrow lag. These lead lag relationships are due to the slow reaction of private market returns to shocks in REIT returns, the risk premium, and consumer sentiment. In contrast, the authors do not observe such a lead lag relationship in the apartment and industrial sectors. The findings have implications regarding portfolio allocation, return predictability, and recommended shifts in the allocation between private and public real estate during crisis periods.</description><author>Hoesli, Martin; Oikarinen, Elias; Serrano, Camilo</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Sep 2015 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>AVERAGES TELL You LITTLE: The Effects of Multifamily Construction on Rents</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Nordby, Hans; Taylor, Michael; Everett, Lee
Over the next several years, U.S. commercial real estate will likely see one of the largest supply waves of multifamily product in recent memory. In this article, the authors examine two economically strong markets, Austin and Boston, which have already started to see significant multifamily construction. The authors look at rent growth of existing properties before and after deliveries in 2013, separating properties by distance to the 2013 deliveries. They find that there is a strong effect on the rent growth of existing properties based on how close they are to new construction. In general, the results show that proximity to new construction is beneficial to average-quality 3 Star properties and detrimental to higher-quality 4 Star and 5 Star properties. The findings reported by the authors will help investors to better position their portfolios against the effects of increased multifamily supply.</description><author>Nordby, Hans; Taylor, Michael; Everett, Lee</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Sep 2015 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Conditional Allocations to Real Estate: An Antidote to Sequencing Risk in Defined Contribution Retirement Plans</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Drew, Michael E.; Walk, Adam N.; West, Jason
In this article, the authors investigate the potential for real estate as an asset class to be exploited to protect against sequencing risk (or path dependency) in defined contribution retirement funds. Their results suggest that allocating both listed and unlisted real estate assets to retirement portfolios, even if very minor, can enhance the risk return profile and probability of successfully achieving retirement outcomes. Using a bootstrap simulation approach, the authors test for a range of asset allocations that include real estate. In addition, they examine the sensitivity of real estate performance to changes in monetary policy to optimize portfolio outcomes for fund managers who actively seek exposure to real estate assets. Their findings indicate that the performance of real estate is highly dependent on monetary policy settings that, when used in a dynamic asset allocation process, have the potential to enhance portfolio returns while limiting the impact of downside risk.</description><author>Drew, Michael E.; Walk, Adam N.; West, Jason</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Sep 2015 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Size Signals Success: Evidence from Real Estate Private Equity</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Krautz, Sebastian; Fuerst, Franz
Anecdotal evidence suggests that clout and connections matter more in private equity fundraising than do actual performance. In this article, a unique real estate private equity dataset with buy-side and sell-side information is created by the authors to construct and analyze stacked interaction networks for each vintage year. Calculating and regressing centrality measures for industry embeddedness, the authors find that fund managers can benefit from their established connections to plan sponsors while fundraising. By adding fund size into the equation, they demonstrate that the total capital under management and the size of previous funds have a significant and positive effect on fundraising speed.</description><author>Krautz, Sebastian; Fuerst, Franz</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Sep 2015 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Performance of Non-Core Private Equity Real Estate Funds: A European View</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Kiehela, Sami; Falkenbach, Heidi
This article examines the performance of European private equity real estate (PERE) funds from 1998 to 2009 using both absolute and relative performance metrics. The authors find that PERE fund absolute returns were significantly dragged down by the financial crisis and, on average, delivered only weak absolute returns. In relative terms, they find that private equity real estate funds underperform the public real estate equities market. They also evaluate the extent of systematic valuation biases of interim fund net asset values and find some evidence of systematic undervaluation of almost 20% of the fund investments, which, when taken into account in performance evaluation, substantially improves the returns.</description><author>Kiehela, Sami; Falkenbach, Heidi</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Sep 2015 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Value and Momentum in Commercial Real Estate: A Market-Level Analysis</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Beracha, Eli; Downs, David H.
Value and momentum strategies are widely recognized by capital market portfolio managers, although commercial real estate evidence is limited. In this article, Beracha and Downs apply these strategies in a market-level analysis using NCREIF data from 1986 through 2014. Conducting the analysis at the market, or MSA level, illustrates its usefulness to an institutional portfolio manager deciding which markets to target or, potentially, exit. Surprisingly, yet consistent with other asset classes, future returns on commercial real estate are positively correlated with the value effect, as measured by relative cap rate, and positively correlated with relative return momentum. Each strategy is robust to risk adjustment and persists over extended investment horizons. As suggested, value and momentum risk factors may benefit institutional investors in establishing benchmarks and monitoring performance.</description><author>Beracha, Eli; Downs, David H.</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Sep 2015 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Does Foreign Investment Affect US Office Real Estate Prices?</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>McAllister, Pat; Nanda, Anupam
This article examines the impact of foreign real estate investment on U.S. office market capitalization rates. The geographic unit of analysis is MSA and the time period is 2001-2013. Drawing upon a database of commercial real estate transactions, the authors model the determinants of market capitalization rates with a particular focus on the significance of the proportion of market transactions involving foreign investors. Employing several econometric techniques to analyze the data, the results suggest statistically significant effects of foreign investment across 38 U.S. metro areas. It is estimated that, all else equal, a 100 basis point increase in foreign share of total investment in a U.S. metropolitan office market causes about an 8 basis point decrease in the market cap rate.</description><author>McAllister, Pat; Nanda, Anupam</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Sep 2015 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Principal-Agent Issues in Real Estate Funds and Joint Ventures</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Pagliari, Joseph L.
The motivations created by the use of incentive fees (or promoted interests) in private equity (real estate or otherwise) are examined through the lens of traditional principal/agent problems. In general, in-the-money promotes tend to create conservative actions by the manager (or agent), and out-of-the-money promotes tend to create risky actions. These incentives are mitigated, however, by a number of factors, including the "moneyness" (the degree to which the promoted interest is in the money) of the promote, the dispersion of potential choices, concerns about future fund-raising efforts, and the changing shape of the manager's utility curve over time (as the manager experiences other gains and losses). Because these incentive fees are intended to improve the alignment of interests between the principal and the agent, this article suggests that lowering both the investor's preferred return and the manager's promoted interest in a manner that maintains the expected value of the promoted interest improves that alignment of interests. Finally, this article also suggests that the use of indexed preferences, rather than a fixed percentage, ought to better serve investors.</description><author>Pagliari, Joseph L.</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Sep 2015 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>New Horizons and Familiar Landscapes: New Capital Sources Confront Shifting Real Estate Fundamentals</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Clayton, Jim; Fabozzi, Frank J.; Giliberto, S. Michael; Gordon, Jacques N.; Liang, Youguo; MacKinnon, Greg; Mansour, Asieh
Real estate has continued to evolve as an asset class. In this introduction to the special issue, the authors examine new sources of capital that have entered real estate, some of which have already had a large impact and others that have the potential to bring major changes in the future. While the capital market foundations of the asset class are changing, the traditional cycle in property fundamentals remains a distinguishing feature, albeit changed from past cycles. As new sources of capital encounter real estate's fundamentals cycle, in-depth understanding of the asset class is imperative. The authors review these trends and suggest how the other articles in this special issue can help investors navigate this confluence of new and old.</description><author>Clayton, Jim; Fabozzi, Frank J.; Giliberto, S.

This article aims to address the relationship between a measure of stock correlation and a decrease in the risk-adjusted performance of basic quantitative investment strategies. The author studied simple momentum, value, size, and mean reversion investment strategies in the U.S. stock market for the period from 1928 to 2012. The empirical results suggest that all strategies appear to be caught in a correlation trap, as they have the tendency to experience a decrease in risk-adjusted performance when the proposed measure of correlation increases. This effect is present over the whole study period, not restricted to the last few years.</description><author>Lamponi, Daniele</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2014 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>No Speed Limits: High-Frequency Trading and Flash Boys</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Bogle, John C.

To exploit return predictability via dynamic asset allocation, investors face the important practical issue of how often to rebalance their portfolios. More frequent rebalancing uses statistically and economically significant short-horizon return predictability to aggressively pursue the dynamic investment opportunities afforded by changes in expected returns. However, the degree of return predictability typically appears stronger at longer horizons, which, along with lower transaction costs, favors less frequent rebalancing. The authors analyze the performance effects of rebalancing frequency in the context of dynamic portfolios constructed from monthly, quarterly, semi-annual, and annual return forecasts for U.S. stocks, bonds, and bills, where the dynamic portfolios rebalance at the same frequency as the forecast horizon. Along the transaction-cost/rebalancing frontier, monthly (annual) rebalancing provides the greatest outperformance when unit transaction costs are below (above) approximately 50 basis points, and dynamic portfolios based on annual rebalancing typically outperform the benchmarks for unit transaction costs well in excess of 400 basis points.</description><author>Almadi, Himanshu; Rapach, David E.; Suri, Anil</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2014 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Enhanced Mean-Variance Portfolios: A Controlled Integration of Quantitative Predictors</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Kaiser, Lars; Menichetti, Marco J.; Veress, Aron
The intuitiveness and practicality of mean variance portfolios largely depend on the accuracy of moment estimates, which are subject to large estimation errors and are conditional on time. The authors propose a model that accounts for factor dynamics in a Bayesian setting, in which they endogenously derive the effect of estimation accuracy on the posterior distribution from a linear predictive regression model. By doing so, they capture upside return potential for periods of high factor-explained variance, while constraining downside risk for periods of low predictive quality. Results are robust in a simulation and an empirical setting.</description><author>Kaiser, Lars; Menichetti, Marco J.; Veress, Aron</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2014 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>On the Expected Performance of Market Timing Strategies</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Hallerbach, Winfried G.
The author derives expressions for the information ratio (IR) that can be expected from directional market-timing strategies. The results hold as accurate approximations and lift the Fundamental Law of Active Management proposed by Richard Grinold in 1989 to an operational level. In addition, the author separates time series-breadth (the timing frequency per strategy) from cross-section breadth (the number of separate markets), because they contribute differently to performance. The author shows that implementing volatility-weighted bet sizes, both in the time series context of a single underlying market and in the cross-section context of multiple markets, increases the expected timing IR. His theoretical results can be used as a benchmark for and reality check on the back-tested performance of timing strategies. He confirms the accuracy of his results by simulating timing strategies for equities and fixed income.</description><author>Hallerbach, Winfried G.</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2014 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>The Glidepath Illusion: An International Perspective</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Estrada, Javier
Target-date funds have become a core product for investors who are saying for retirement. These funds periodically reduce their allocations to stocks and increase their allocations to bonds and cash, becoming more conservative as retirement approaches. This lifecycle strategy implies that investors are aggressive with little capital and conservative with much more capital, which may be suboptimal in terms of wealth accumulation. This article evaluates three alternative types of strategies, including contrarian strategies that follow a glidepath opposite that of target-date funds; that is, they become more aggressive as retirement approaches. The results from a comprehensive sample that spans more than 19 countries, two regions, and 110 years suggest that, relative to lifecycle strategies, the alternative strategies considered here provide investors with higher upside potential, more limited downside potential, and higher uncertainty although that uncertainty is largely limited to how much higher their terminal wealth is expected to grow with these strategies.</description><author>Estrada, Javier</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2014 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>The Limitations of Diversification Return</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Chambers, Donald R.; Zdanowicz, John S.
Diversification return is the amount by which the geometric mean return (i.e., average compounded return) of a portfolio exceeds the weighted average of the geometric means of the portfolio's constituent assets. Diversification return has been touted as a source of added return, even if markets are informationally efficient. Portfolio rebalancing has been advocated as a valuable source of diversification return. The authors demonstrate that diversification return is not a source of increased expected value. However, portfolio rebalancing can be an effective mean-reverting strategy. Any enhanced expected value from rebalancing emanates from mean-reversion, rather than from diversification or variance reduction.</description><author>Chambers, Donald R.; Zdanowicz, John S.</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2014 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Conviction in Equity Investing</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Sebastian, Mike; Attaluri, Sudhakar
In this article, the authors examine the record of active public equity managers by separating investment products into skilled, unskilled, and no evidence of skill categories. They find that less than 2% of products exhibited evidence of skill over the time period. The authors argue that institutional investors spend far more resources on selecting and monitoring active managers than is warranted by the results, either in terms of portfolio results (contribution to risk) or added value. The authors divide their sample into deciles of active risk (volatility of excess returns relative to the investment manager's chosen benchmark, and also Fama-French style benchmarks) and find a clear positive relationship between active risk and value added. They argue that a lack of willingness to take large bets, due to career risk fears, accounts for the poor value-added results of active equity managers and that the preference of institutional investors and their advisors for over-diversification and precise control of risk and style has contributed to the industry's weak record. Investment managers, asset owners, and their advisors, the authors argue, must step up to act with the courage of their convictions in portfolio management.</description><author>Sebastian, Mike; Attaluri, Sudhakar</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2014 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>A Study of Low-Volatility Portfolio Construction Methods</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Chow, Tzee-man; Hsu, Jason C.; Kuo, Li-lan; Li, Feifei
In this study, the authors examine the hypothetical performance of various low volatility strategies in historical U.S., global developed, and emerging markets. The strategies we replicated outperformed cap-weighted market indices due to exposure to the value, BAB (betting against beta), and duration factors. (The duration factor introduced by the authors here is new to the literature.) A reduction in market beta drives the drop in volatility. The authors report that low volatility strategies can contribute to a more risk-diversified equity portfolio which earns long-term returns from multiple premium sources. The lower risk and higher return seem persistent across geographies and over time. Nonetheless, the authors identify flaws with naive approaches to portfolio construction, which tend to result in high turnover, low liquidity, and concentrated country and industry allocations. Additionally, price increases would eliminate low volatility stocks' performance advantage. The conclusion of the authors is that the portfolio construction methods should be sensitive to the investability and valuation levels.</description><author>Chow, Tzee-man; Hsu, Jason C.; Kuo, Li-lan; Li, Feifei</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2014 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Towards Smart Equity Factor Indices: Harvesting Risk Premia without Taking Unrewarded Risks</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Amenc, Noel; Goltz, Felix; Lodh, Ashish; Martellini, Lionel
This article argues that current smart-beta investment approaches provide only a partial answer to the main shortcomings of capitalization-weighted indices and develops a new approach to equity investing, which the authors refer to as smart-factor investing. The authors then provide an assessment of the benefits of simultaneously addressing the two main problems of cap-weighted indices their undesirable factor exposures and their heavy concentration by constructing factor indices that explicitly seek exposures to rewarded risk factors, while diversifying away unrewarded risks. The results suggest that such smart-factor indices lead to considerable improvements in risk-adjusted performance. For long-term U.S. data, smart-factor indices for a range of different factor tilts consistently outperform cap-weighted, factor-tilted indices. Compared with the broad cap-weighted index, smart-factor indices roughly double the risk-adjusted return (Sharpe ratio). Outperformance of such indices persists at levels ranging from 2.92% to 4.46% annually, even when assuming unrealistically high transaction costs. Moreover, by providing explicit tilts to consensual factors, such indices improve upon many current smart-beta offerings where, more often than not, factor tilts exist as unintended consequences of ad hoc methodologies.</description><author>Amenc, Noel; Goltz, Felix; Lodh, Ashish; Martellini, Lionel</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2014 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Is Smart Beta Still Smart after Taxes?</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Vadlamudi, Hemambara; Bouchey, Paul
In this article, the authors focus on the after-tax performance of several smart-beta strategies. These strategies have higher turnover than the capitalization-weighted index, which leads to a greater tax on returns. Despite this drag, most strategies retain a long-term excess return. The authors also test the effectiveness of tax-managed versions of the strategies. They observe that, relative to most active managers, smart-beta strategies have lower turnover, greater breadth, and are less concerned with stock selection. By allowing a tracking-error risk budget versus the original strategy, tax management can reduce much of the tax impact.</description><author>Vadlamudi, Hemambara; Bouchey, Paul</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2014 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Multi-Asset Sentiment and Institutional Investor Behavior: A Cross-Asset Perspective</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Froot, Kenneth A.; Bhargava, Rajeev; Cuipa, Edward S.; Arabadjis, John S.
Greater financial integration and central bank policy initiatives in major developed markets have led to an increase in cross-asset return correlations, highlighting the interest in broad measures of market-wide sentiment. Using an extensive array of institutional behavioral metrics across asset classes, the authors find evidence that suggests market-wide sentiment varies with, and can be forecasted by, broad aggregates across many indicators of institutional investor flows. The large number and wide breadth of these institutional flow measures across assets encourages aggregation into a more manageable set of elements. To this end, the authors condense this broad information set into what they call a multi-asset sentiment score (MASS), a concise measure of behavior that captures trading sentiment using a broad information set.</description><author>Froot, Kenneth A.; Bhargava, Rajeev; Cuipa, Edward S.; Arabadjis, John S.</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2014 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Academic Knowledge Dissemination in the Mutual Fund Industry: Can Mutual Funds Successfully Adopt Factor Investing Strategies?</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>van Gelderen, Eduard; Huij, Joop
The authors investigate whether investors who have adopted investment strategies based on asset pricing anomalies documented in the academic literature consistently earn abnormal returns. They evaluate the performance of a large sample of U.S. equity mutual funds over the period from 1990 to 2010. They find evidence supporting added value for investors who adopt factor-investing strategies: low-beta, small-cap and value funds earn significant excess returns. They also find that these excess returns are sustainable and have not disappeared after the public dissemination of the anomalies. The authors propose some criteria that might be helpful to determine the successful application of academic insights in the context of investment strategies. Their findings have significant implications for the role of academic research and knowledge management in the investment management industry.</description><author>van Gelderen, Eduard; Huij, Joop</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2014 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Evaluating Trading Strategies</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Harvey, Campbell R.; Liu, Yan

Moreover, the S&amp;P 500's index-return variance, average between-constituent return correlation, average constituent relative-return variance, and average constituent residual-return variance are all positively related to a statistically significant degree.

In the current low real-yield environment, institutional investors are challenged as they try to achieve their often-fixed targeted returns within the confines of their investment policy guidelines. If much-discussed solutions, such as risk parity and risk premia investing, are the new answers, they must improve portfolio efficiency and flexibility in taking risks. This article explores the ways these proposed solutions may be successful. The author argues that the solutions neither introduce new assets that offer non-replicable, non-redundant return and risk characteristics, nor do they offer new asset-pricing theories that improve forecasts of asset returns or risks. Instead, their value proposition is more in the category of improved portfolio construction. They primarily benefit practitioners by providing more-efficient risk allocations, which they do by relaxing constraints to which pension investors are often subject, including restrictions on using leverage and short selling.</description><author>Lee, Wai</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2014 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Risk- versus Trend-Driven Global Tactical Asset Allocation</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Guilleminot, Benoit; Ohana, Jean-Jacques; Ohana, Steve
The 2008 financial crisis has severely challenged passive forms of investment. In this article, the authors compare two systematic investment processes that a global asset allocator may employ to preserve its capital in a turbulent financial environment. The risk-driven allocation, derived from the popular risk-parity approach, has garnered a strong interest from both scholars and practitioners in recent years. It aims at enforcing a constant risk target and maintaining a balanced risk profile over time. This article introduces a novel trend-driven approach that enhances the risk-driven strategy by cutting exposure to downward-drifting assets. The authors compare the risk-adjusted performances of risk- and trend-driven approaches on different investment universes (composed of equity, commodity, currency, and bond futures contracts) from 1993 to 2012. They find that a trend-driven approach yields increased Sharpe ratios and lower drawdowns on average, relative to a risk-driven strategy. However, the trend-driven process's outperformance is not stable over time: periods with exploitable trends alternate with long-lasting trendless periods. Overall, the trending strategy's key advantage over the risk-driven one is its greater smoothness. This is due to a better resilience to financial melt-downs like those seen from 2000 to 2002 and in 2008, which are well predicted by trending signals and undermine the diversification objective the risk-parity approach pursues. These results demonstrate the value of coupling risk and trajectorial signals in tactical asset allocation.</description><author>Guilleminot, Benoit; Ohana, Jean-Jacques; Ohana, Steve</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2014 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Rethinking Portfolio Rebalancing: Introducing Risk Contribution Rebalancing as an Alternative Approach to Traditional Value-Based Rebalancing Strategies</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Kohler, Alexander; Wittig, Hagen
The authors propose a new approach to portfolio rebalancing: by decomposing the investor's strategic asset allocation into the various asset classes' percentage contributions to risk. Instead of the asset classes' commonly used value weights, a practitioner would apply this set of risk contributions to controlling rebalancing procedures during the investment phase. In strong contrast to traditional value-based rebalancing strategies, the resulting risk contribution strategies are capable of triggering rebalancing procedures, based on deviations in an asset class's standalone volatility or correlation to the portfolio's remaining asset classes. Thus, this method lets practitioners closely maintain the asset classes' initial risk contributions. In performance terms, during the backtesting sample period from January 1996 to February 2013, the rebalancing strategies based on risk contributions deliver returns that are comparable to traditional value-based rebalancing strategies, but at much lower volatility levels, which translates into higher Sharpe ratios.</description><author>Kohler, Alexander; Wittig, Hagen</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2014 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>The Power of Dynamic Asset Allocation</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Cardinale, Mirko; Navone, Marco; Pioch, Andrzej
This article re-assesses the evidence and practical relevance of asset returns' long-horizon predictability, investigating whether practitioners can profitably exploit predictability patterns by using relatively simple, dynamic asset allocation strategies. The analysis shows forward-looking models that rely on steady-state equations for equities and initial yields to maturity for bonds are far better predictors of markets' long-run direction than is the industry's conventional approach, which involves extrapolating from historical averages. Using a long-term U.S. sample from 1926 to 2010, the authors find that predictability translates into significantly better 34 risk-adjusted performance from dynamic asset allocation strategies that rely on forward-looking inputs.</description><author>Cardinale, Mirko; Navone, Marco; Pioch, Andrzej</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2014 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Exploring Macroeconomic Sensitivities: How Investments Respond to Different Economic Environments</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Ilmanen, Antti; Maloney, Thomas; Ross, Adrienne
A growing number of investors view their portfolios as a collection of exposures to risk factors. Risk-based investing can mean different things to different investors, but the common feature is the emphasis on improved risk diversification. Many investors identify risks primarily as asset class exposures; others may look at underlying macroeconomic exposures, such as inflation sensitivity. The difficulty with the latter approach is that macroeconomic factors are not directly investable. In this article, the authors study the sensitivity of traditional asset classes and dynamic strategies to different macroeconomic environments: growth, inflation, real yields, volatility, and illiquidity. They identify environments that are particularly challenging for investors and find evidence that dynamic systematic strategies, known as style premia, have meaningfully less macro exposure than do asset classes. They also show how diversification reduces portfolios' macro risk exposures.</description><author>Ilmanen, Antti; Maloney, Thomas; Ross, Adrienne</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2014 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Are Flows Costly to ETF Investors?</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Henderson, Brian J.; Buetow, Gerald W.
Authorized participants create and redeem exchange-traded fund (ETF) shares in response to supply and demand imbalances in the secondary market. For the majority of ETFs, share creations and redemptions take place as in-kind transactions, but a growing number of ETFs feature cash creations and redemptions. The authors investigate whether ETF flows are costly to investors. Using a reasonable proxy for the potential cost of fund flows, they find evidence of underperformance associated with flows to ETFs featuring cash creations and redemptions and tracking international benchmarks. Because ETF flows do not predict subsequent returns and the authors do not find evidence the funds are susceptible to market-timing strategies, the costs likely stem from the transaction costs associated with the portfolio trades that are necessary to accommodate cash liquidity.</description><author>Henderson, Brian J.; Buetow, Gerald W.</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2014 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Explanations for the Volatility Effect: An Overview Based on the CAPM Assumptions</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Blitz, David; Falkenstein, Eric; van Vliet, Pim
The capital asset pricing model (CAPM) predicts a positive relation between risk and return, but empirical studies find that the actual relation is flat, or even negative. This article provides a broad overview of explanations for this volatility effect and categorizes each explanation according to the CAPM assumption to which it relates. Various explanations relate to investor behavior that is rational, given exogenous incentive structures or constraints, which may explain why the volatility effect has been so persistent over time.

Instead, prices exhibit strong autocorrelation, often resulting in predictable one-directional sequences, or runs. These runs are more pronounced ahead of market crashes. Identifying these runs can help predict impending flash crashes as much as a day before a crash. The research further contributes to asset pricing and derivatives literature by deriving discreet and continuous closed-form expressions for the probability of flash crashes.</description><author>Aldridge, Irene</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2014 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Forecasting US Bond Returns: A Practitioner's Perspective</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Mylnikov, George
This article presents a practitioner's view of the evidence on the predictability of U.S. bond returns, using forward rates found in the academic literature. The author examines this evidence from a dual perspective: statistical and economic. He finds that the regressions of monthly returns of U.S. Treasury futures on the set of three forward rates, with one-, five- and ten-year expirations, are statistically viable. An implementation of these forecasts as an investment strategy shows that it is historically profitable on a risk-adjusted basis. Furthermore, the author demonstrates the importance of the dual approach to assessing predictability, by providing an example of a slightly modified version of the main model that is more intuitive, more parsimonious, and statistically more robust, yet it fails to exhibit better economic performance.</description><author>Mylnikov, George</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2014 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Recent Trends in Equity Portfolio Construction Analytics</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Pachamanova, Dessislava A.; Fabozzi, Frank J.
Portfolio analytics is critical for identifying investment opportunities, keeping portfolios aligned with investment objectives, and monitoring portfolio risk and performance. Analytics-based portfolio management lets investment managers filter information quickly, take advantage of statistical arbitrage opportunities, and deal with inefficiencies, such as transaction costs incurred during trading and tax consequences of investment decisions. This article reviews some widely used approaches to portfolio analytics, discussing new trends in metrics, modeling approaches, and portfolio analytics system design. Topics include stock screening, text analytics, traditional and new uses for factor models, investment methodologies of recent interest (such as smart beta), new visualization and analytics features available from vendors and open source software, and cloud-based solutions for data management and analysis.</description><author>Pachamanova, Dessislava A.; Fabozzi, Frank J.</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2014 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Portfolio Risk Management Using the Lorenz Curve</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Shalit, Haim
This article presents a methodology for using the Lorenz curve in financial economics. Most of the recent quantitative risk measures that abide by the rules of second-degree stochastic dominance, such as Gini's mean difference and conditional value at risk, are associated with the Lorenz curve. With financial data, the Lorenz curve is easy to calculate, because it requires sorting asset returns in ascending order. A financial analyst can derive the statistics necessary to carry out a study of risk analysis and establish a set of efficient and most-preferred portfolios for all risk-averse investors.</description><author>Shalit, Haim</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2014 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Volatility versus Tail Risk: Which One Is Compensated in Equity Funds?</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Xiong, James X.; Idzorek, Thomas M.; Ibbotson, Roger G.

The authors present a methodology for attributing an asset's or portfolio's predicted beta to an underlying set of factors. The approach's foundation rests on the concept of factor beta, which represents the beta of a factor portfolio with respect to the market portfolio. This analysis gives investors important insights into the drivers of predicted beta for a particular portfolio. The authors also study the cross-sectional dispersion of stock-level predicted betas. They show that the dispersion can be decomposed into contributions from individual factors. This framework provides valuable insight into how factor volatilities and correlations affect observed differences in stocks' predicted betas.</description><author>Wang, Jackson; Menchero, Jose</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2014 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>The Dark Side of Passive Investing</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Blitz, David

This article explores the effectiveness of the cyclically adjusted price-earnings (CAPE) ratio to detect over- or undervaluation of sectors within the U.S. economy. The authors modify the original notion of the ratio from several empirical studies by John Campbell and Robert Shiner, not only to ensure unifolln corporate payout policies, but also to allow comparisons across the sectors' potentially differing accounting standards and varying growth expectations. Considering sector-level CAPE information back to the early 1980s, the authors translate the CAPE-based valuation signals into a sector rotation strategy, whose long-term value nature is complemented by a supplemental momentum adjustment, in order to eliminate value traps. The performance enhancement associated with the CAPE-based sector rotation extends to European sectors as an out-of-sample test.</description><author>Bunn, Oliver; Staal, Arne; Zhuang, Ji; Lazanas, Anthony; Ural, Cenk; Shiller, Robert</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2014 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>International Low-Risk Investing</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Walkshausl, Christian
This article comprehensively examines the performance, investment behavior, and co-movement of minimum-volatility, low-volatility, and low-beta strategies in international markets. First, the authors identify the significant over-weighting of non-cyclical stocks from the consumer staples and utilities sectors, relative to the market, as one of the main, industry-specific return drivers of all low-risk strategies. Second, minimum-volatility, low-volatility, and low-beta strategies produce similarly substantial and statistically significant CAPM and three-factor model alphas in the segments of developed markets and emerging markets over the complete sample period, before and after the recent financial crisis. However, during the crisis, there was no significant outperformance, though low-risk strategies could keep risk down. All low-risk strategies share general commonalities with small-cap and value strategies, except in the European market, where they resemble growth strategies. Third, minimum-volatility, low-volatility, and low-beta strategies generally exhibit large and significant co-movements across and within markets. The authors do not find compelling evidence that one strategy generally dominates another. They conclude that minimum-volatility, low-volatility, and low-beta strategies are equally beneficial for participating in low-risk investing around the world.</description><author>Walkshausl, Christian</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2014 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Option-Implied Volatilities and Stock Returns: Evidence from Industry-Neutral Portfolios</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Liu, Xiaoquan; Pong, Eddie S.

Recent studies demonstrate the profitability of stock portfolios constructed according to implied volatility measures inferred from option prices. This article examines industry effects on such portfolios' performance. Results show that quintile portfolios constructed using volatility skew and volatility spread are subject to substantial industry effects, which are particularly strong during market turbulence. The authors form industry-neutral portfolios and compare their performances to those of frill-universe portfolios that do not consider industry exposure. Results show significant improvement when portfolio strategies are implemented in an industry-neutral manner, based on either volatility skew or volatility spread.</description><author>Liu, Xiaoquan; Pong, Eddie S.

Bond returns are known to exhibit mean reversion, auto-correlation, and other dynamic properties that differentiate them from stock returns. Index-linked bonds bring in further characteristics that complicate the task of modeling returns over time. Such models are essential, however, in strategic portfolio analysis and quantitative risk management. This article shows that the modeling of index-linked bond portfolios can be reduced to statistical modeling of the portfolio's yield to maturity and the underlying index. For these quantities, many well-established models already exist. Using historical data from 12 different markets, the authors show that the two risk factors consistently explain more than 98% of monthly return variations over the past decade, including the recent financial crisis.</description><author>Koivu, Matti; Pennanen, Teemu</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2014 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Optimal Tax Management of Municipal Bonds</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Kalotay, Andrew
Municipal bonds are held in taxable accounts because the interest is tax-exempt, but gains and losses are subject to complex tax treatment. The author explains how selling at a loss when the market value falls below the investor's tax basis can improve after-tax performance. The hold value, which can differ substantially from the market price, is a key part of calculating the potential benefit from sale. The difference between the sale proceeds and the hold value shows the benefit of selling. If the benefit is positive, the question is whether to act now or wait for a possibly better opportunity. The answer lies in the transaction's tax efficiency, which compares the benefit captured to the value of the tax option (i.e., the right to take a tax loss at any time). The latter's value depends on interest-rate volatility and transaction costs. The author recommends selling only if the benefit captures a high percentage of the forfeited tax option (i.e., if the tax efficiency is sufficiently high).</description><author>Kalotay, Andrew</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2014 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Coming Up Short: Managing Underfunded Portfolios in an LDI-ES Framework</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Das, Sanjiv; Kim, Seoyoung; Statman, Meir
The authors present a liability-directed investment (LDI) rebalancing framework that is based on expected shortfall (ES), denoted as LDI-ES, to prescribe remedies for an underfunded portfolio. Investors endowed with some current wealth optimize their target wealth at the end of N periods, subject to their tolerance for shortfalls from that target wealth. The authors contrast LDI-ES rebalancing with fixed-proportions rebalancing, in which portfolio allocations are rebalanced to ratios, such as 60:40, at the beginning of each of N periods. They consider critical issues of underfunding, in which no portfolio can meet the shortfall constraint, as well as the effectiveness of portfolio infusions in resolving underfunded situations relative to other measures, such as increasing risk, cutting back on target liabilities or goals, and extending the portfolio horizon.</description><author>Das, Sanjiv; Kim, Seoyoung; Statman, Meir</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2014 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Donation Risk and Optimal Endowment Portfolio Allocations</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Blanchett, David
An endowment is only one component of the total economic worth of a charitable organization. Other assets, such as real estate, donation revenue, and program service fees generally represent a larger portion of the total wealth of a charity yet are often ignored in the endowment optimization process. This article provides evidence that changes in charitable donations, referred to as donation risk, have statistically significant exposures to different asset classes and risk factors. Through a series of portfolio optimizations it is determined that the optimal allocation for an endowment varies materially for different compositions of total wealth. These findings suggest that narrowly focused portfolio optimization routines that ignore donation risk are insufficient, and that a holistic definition of wealth is necessary to build truly efficient endowment portfolios.</description><author>Blanchett, David</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2014 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Higher-Frequency Analysis of Low-Frequency Data</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Mallinger-Dogan, Mickael; Szigety, Mark C.
Low-frequency data present significant challenges to investors because infrequent observations lead to imperfect intra-period understandings of market behavior, which in turn frustrate risk management and portfolio monitoring. Nowhere is this phenomenon more vexing than in portfolios that include both liquid and illiquid investments, whose low-frequency reporting compromises an investor's ability to form a holistic portfolio perspective. The authors examine the consequences of this issue and evaluate two methodologies for interpolating low-frequency data to facilitate use in higher-frequency settings. Through a numerical study, they determine that the decision to use one methodology over another or whether to interpolate at all is context-dependent, and illustrate the effect of higher-frequency interpolation on risk evaluation, attribution, and other common risk measures.</description><author>Mallinger-Dogan, Mickael; Szigety, Mark C.</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2014 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Tesla: Anatomy of a Run-Up</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Cornell, Bradford; Damodaran, Aswath
This article presents a detailed anatomy of the nearly sevenfold run-up in the price of Tesla stock between March 22, 2013 and February 26, 2014, and attempts to determine the role played by investor sentiment. Tesla offers a unique opportunity in this context because the run-up was on the order of magnitude experienced by some of the most volatile technology stocks, but Tesla operates in an industry automotive manufacturing and a potential industry battery construction that are mature and populated by established competitors. This makes it possible to construct discounted cash flow valuation models that are anchored to established fundamentals. On the basis of these models, in conjunction with a detailed event study and analysis of institutional stock holdings and short-sales data, the authors conclude that the run-up cannot be explained as a rational reaction to fundamental information. Instead, they conclude that, at the end of the run-up, the stock was overvalued by approximately 150%. In their view, the case study provides support for the assertion by Lawrence Summers that price and rational value can diverge significantly for prolonged periods of time.</description><author>Cornell, Bradford; Damodaran, Aswath</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2014 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Cost of Asset Allocation in Equity Market: How Much Do Investors Lose Due to Bad Asset Class Design?</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Kim, Woo Chang; Lee, Yongjae; Lee, Yoon Hak
Many investors employ asset allocation, even though most are not really concerned about how their asset classification schemes affect investment performance. This article extensively examines the two most widely employed within-stock classifications: styles and industry classification. In order to explicitly measure current classifications' performance levels, the authors introduce the concept of optimal asset classification, which provides the upper performance limit of any classification scheme. They find that style and industry classification are very costly. Furthermore, factor analysis reveals that the immediate cause of exorbitant cost lies in the method on which classification focuses.</description><author>Kim, Woo Chang; Lee, Yongjae; Lee, Yoon Hak</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2014 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Portfolio Concentration and the Geometry of Co-Movement</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Phoa, Wesley

This article describes a method for transforming a correlation matrix into a point cloud in space, in which two points are close if the corresponding assets are highly correlated, and vice versa. Latent structures in the correlation matrix can thus be visualized geometrically. The method also provides an intuitive way to visualize how the correlation matrix changes over time, and can be used to derive quantitative measures of portfolio concentration.</description><author>Phoa, Wesley</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2013 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>How to Represent Mark-to-Market Possibilities with the General Portfolio Selection Model</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Markowitz, Harry M.

One of the most frequently cited criticisms of quantitative investing has been the charge that everyone uses the same factors and models. In other words, the popular strategies of the last few decades, such as value and momentum, have become crowded, leaving little room for investors to generate alpha. But is this actually true?

Private fund-based portfolios present significant exposureand liquidity-management challenges, because committing new funds and conducting secondary sales both have complex relationships to eventual exposure levels and net cash flows. This article presents a framework for evaluating candidate rebalancing strategies within the context of organizational objectives and concerns. It explicitly acknowledges the usefulness of secondary sales, and of modeling cash flows as stochastic processes. The author finds that simple commitment and sales rules that essentially depend only on distance from the target work reasonably well, but that the precise formulation of these rules depends on the specific situation. Institutions that value adherence to policy targets over other concerns will gravitate toward a rebalancing strategy that involves highly responsive commitment and sales rates, both when starting from zero and when overallocated. But for institutions that are less concerned with adherence to policy targets, optimal rebalancing strategies depend on the formulation of the initial problem. In cases of overallocation, even these patient organizations may need highly responsive sales rules to correct the overexposure within a reasonable time.</description><author>Szigety, Mark C.</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2013 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Is the Diversification Benefit of Frontier Markets Realizable by Mean-Variance Investors?

The authors investigate whether the diversification benefits of frontier markets are realizable. They focus on investable frontier exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and their corresponding indices. Their analysis includes directly measuring the economic benefits of frontier-market diversification, as well as considering frontier-market trading dynamics. Evidence indicates that frontier markets offer diversification benefits through their risk-reducing potential. The authors find that frontier market volatility tends to be largely idiosyncratic, which supports the risk-reducing role of frontier markets. Their comparison of funds and indices indicates that, to the extent that frontier-market indices offer hypothetical benefits, traders can obtain these benefits by using investable funds.</description><author>Berger, Dave; Pukthuanthong, Kuntara; Yang, J.

In this article the authors challenge the standard method for measuring value that is used in academic work on factor pricing. The standard method uses lagged book data to calculate book-to-price (B/P) at portfolio formation. It aligns price data using the same lag, ignoring recent price movements. The authors propose two simple alternatives that use more timely price data; they then construct portfolios based on the different measures for a U.S. sample (from 1950 to 2011) and a global sample (from 1983 to 2011). They show that B/P ratios based on more timely prices better forecast true, unobservable B/P ratios at fiscal year-end. Value portfolios based on the timeliest measures earn statistically significant alphas, ranging between 305 and 378 basis points per year, versus the standard method.</description><author>Asness, Clifford; Frazzini, Andrea</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2013 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Earnings Quality Revisited</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Bender, Jennifer; Nielsen, Frank
Earnings quality as an investment signal has been popular among equity portfolio managers for the last decade. The basic idea behind this accruals anomaly is that stocks with high and increasing accruals tend to have low earnings quality, while stocks with low and decreasing accruals tend to have high earnings quality. The earnings quality signal stopped working in the mid-2000s, but has staged a remarkable rebound since the end of 2008. The authors evaluate whether earnings quality is a true alpha signal, a risk factor, or both. They find that, in the periods when the signal worked, the strategy was largely driven by stock selection, suggesting that earnings quality is indeed an alpha signal. The authors also find that earnings quality is not a good risk factor, in that it does not have high statistical significance when regressed cross-sectionally on returns, along with other well-known risk factors, and is not very volatile over time. Overall, their results indicate that earnings quality may be that rare example of a pure alpha factor.</description><author>Bender, Jennifer; Nielsen, Frank</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2013 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Which Component of Treasury Yields Belongs in Equity Valuation Models?

Given a relaxation of the expectations hypothesis of interest rates and an estimate of the term premium, the remaining assumption that anticipated distant-horizon nominal expected short rates and projected earnings growth are equivalent implies novel cash-flow-based valuation models for shares. For example, an application of a simple dividend-discount framework to the S&amp;P 500, under 600 alternative specifications (to avoid data mining), using a sample from January 1987 through January 2012, fits the data well.

Recent index literature is replete with innovations that are based on quantitative strategies and predicated on sensible investment beliefs. Empirical studies confirm that these strategies deliver economically large and statistically significant excess returns over cap-weighted market benchmarks in nearly all regions and countries, over long periods of time. In this article, the authors show that inverting these poitfolio-construction algorithms does not reverse the out-performance. Indeed, the upside-down strategies often outperform the originals. This paradoxical result is driven by the phenomenon that seemingly unrelated, non-value-based strategies and their inverted counterparts often have unintended and almost unavoidable value and small-cap tilts. Even Burt Malkiel's legendary blindfolded monkey, throwing darts at the Wall Street Journal's stock page, would produce a portfolio with a substantial value- and small-cap bias that would have historically outperformed the S&amp;P 500. The value and small-cap tilts stem from the fact that non-price-based weighting schemes sever the link between a company's share price and its weight in the portfolio. Clearly, the inverted strategy of a non-price-weighted strategy is still a non-price-weighted strategy, would consequently have a value and small-cap tilt, and would therefore have outperformed historically.</description><author>Arnott, Robert D.; Hsu, Jason; Kalesnik, Vitali; Tindall, Phil</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2013 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Is There Alpha in Institutional Emerging-Market Equity Funds?</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Lin, Wenling
Can active fund managers outperform the passive index in the global emerging-markets equity arena? To answer this question, the author delineates emerging-market fund strategies and applies multifactor approaches to a unique data set, consisting of institutional emerging-market managers' returns from Russell Investments. This analysis produced five major findings from January 1997 to June 2011: 1) product varieties have proliferated in this asset class; 2) active management can work in this asset class, but investors have relied more on research to hire good managers; 3) value managers tend to have higher alphas historically, but the supply of value managers is smaller than that of growth-or market-oriented managers; 4) price momentum, valuation, Asia, and the resources sector are key risk drivers; and 5) active risks from this asset class are still present, so it's important to diversify across multiple strategies and styles to mitigate unwanted risks. Alphas are obtainable, but they are not free.</description><author>Lin, Wenling</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2013 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Create or Buy: A Comparative Analysis of Liquidity and Transaction Costs for Selected US ETFs</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Borkovec, Milan; Serbin, Vitaly
Examining 12 popular exchange-traded funds (ETFs), the authors find that ETFs and common stocks exhibit qualitatively different liquidity and cost characteristics. The limit order book for ETFs is deeper than that of common stocks, with similar daily share volume, price, spread, and volatility characteristics, especially at price levels immediately surrounding the prevailing mid-quote. The differences in trading mechanisms and liquidity provision between ETFs and common stocks affect transaction costs. In order to reflect these differences, an appropriate transaction cost model should be properly calibrated and parameterized. It should also consolidate the entire ETF liquidity accessible on the secondary market and through the creation/redemption procedure. The authors demonstrate that considering cost estimates for trading ETFs' underlying constituents provides additional clarity about an ETF's true cost. Their comparison of ETF and basket costs, in conjunction with a look at creation/redemption fees, indicates the need for monitoring relative ETF liquidity, as the optimal switching points between trading an ETF and creating/redeeming vary widely across ETFs and trading styles.</description><author>Borkovec, Milan; Serbin, Vitaly</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2013 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Fundamentally Weighted Global Small Companies</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Bull, Peter M.
The author presents an empirical analysis into the issue of universe definition for a fundamentally weighted, global small-company equity strategy. Consistent with previous research on fundamental indexing for large companies, the author confirms the performance advantages of weighting securities by fundamental measures of company size, as opposed to market capitalization, for a variety of global small-company strategies. Beyond these results, the author provides evidence that small-company strategies that define their universe by market capitalization criteria, in the manner of traditional small-cap indices, enjoy a performance advantage over those that use fundamental-ranking criteria. Although this improvement in risk-adjusted performance is accompanied by marginally increased total risk and turnover, rudimentary adjustments to the market cap-defined universe counteract both effects.</description><author>Bull, Peter M.</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2013 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Innovation and Portfolio Management</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Cohen, Abby Joseph

Losses on U.S. residential mortgage loans are too small to explain the magnitude of the 2008 financial crisis. Total losses, including both losses realized to date and those yet to be realized, should fall in the range of $750 billion to $2 trillion. The global magnitude of the crisis is significantly larger, probably in the range of $5 trillion to $15 trillion, depending on the measuring approach. This implies that losses on residential mortgage loans cannot be the main cause of the crisis. They can only be a trigger that unleashed the true causes. The failure (or near failure) of a significant number of major financial firms suggests that high leverage and strong risk appetites were important immediate causes of the crisis. However, explaining the sources of high leverage and strong risk appetites requires probing for deeper causes that developed over a longer period. This article proposes deeper causes that include securities firms' conversion from partnerships to corporations, the 30-year deregulation trend, the quant movement, the spread of risk-taking culture throughout the financial industry, and globalization.</description><author>Adelson, Mark</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2013 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>What Moves Stock Prices: Another Look</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Cornell, Bradford
In 1989, Culter, Poterba, and Summers published an article examining the extent to which ex post movements in aggregate stock prices could be attributed to the arrival of news. They concluded that most of the 50 largest movements in the S&amp;P 500 could not be matched with any convincing explanation for why future profits or discount rates might have changed. Since 1989, there has been an explosion in information technology, enhanced market regulation, and stock-trading innovation, as well as the introduction of new, equity-related financial products. The author explores whether Culter, Poterba, and Summers's conclusion still holds, and reports that it is intact. If anything, the mystery has deepened, because the size of unexplained market movements has grown.</description><author>Cornell, Bradford</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2013 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Do You Know What's in Your Benchmark?</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Crawford, Steven; Hansen, James; Price, Richard

This article compares the performance of minimum-variance portfolios based on four different covariance matrix estimators, using daily return data from the German stock market. To assess whether investing in ex ante minimum-variance portfolios is a recommendable way to achieve efficient portfolios in accordance with Markowitz's mean-variance optimization, the authors benchmark the four portfolios' performance against the German stock index DAX, which also determines the investable universe. This is the first study that uses not only historical volatility and covariance data, but also implied volatilities from the stock options market to estimate the covariance matrix. The article also analyzes how results change when the shrinkage method, suggested by Ledoit and Wolf in a 2003 article published in this journal, is applied to both the historical and the implied volatility estimators. The authors demonstrate that all minimum-variance portfolios outperform the DAX index. The implied-volatility estimator, modified by the shrinkage method, offered the best results in terms of volatility, return, and efficiency ratio. In contrast to previous empirical results, applying the shrinkage method to the historical sample covariance matrix yields little benefit, if any. However, applying the shrinkage method to the implied-volatility estimator significantly improves the quality of the covariance estimation, resulting in improved performance from the minimum-variance portfolio.</description><author>Mostowfi, Mehdi; Stier, Carolin</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2013 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>The Blind Side: Managing Downside Risk in Corporate Defined-Benefit Plans</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Sheikh, Abdullah Z.; Sun, Jianxiong
Following the recession of the early 2000s, defined benefit corporate pension plans faced dramatic funding challenges. They had barely recovered before the recession of 2008 to 2009 sent funding ratios tumbling once again. Many plan sponsors must now make larger contributions than they originally budgeted, in order to bring their plans back to full funding. This article aims to deepen the current discussion of risk reduction in the context of defined benefit plans It investigates two key issues. First, its authors analyze the effect of non-normality of asset returns on a defined benefit pension plan's liabilities. They argue that analytical frameworks that assume normality can lead to an underestimation of downside risk, a concern with regard to contributions. Second, the authors develop a multi-dimensional risk-management framework for managing contribution risk.</description><author>Sheikh, Abdullah Z.; Sun, Jianxiong</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2013 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Leverage Aversion, Efficient Frontiers, and the Efficient Region</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Jacobs, Bruce I.; Levy, Kenneth N.

Analytic solutions to risk parity, maximum diversification, and minimum variance portfolios provide useful perspectives about their construction and composition. Individual asset weights depend on both systematic and idiosyncratic risk in all three risk-based portfolios, but systematic risk eliminates many investable assets in long-only, constrained, maximum-diversification, and minimum-variance portfolios. On the other hand, risk-parity portfolios include all investable assets, and idiosyncratic risk has little effect on weight magnitude. The algebraic forms for optimal asset weights derived in this article yield generalizable properties of risk-based portfolios, in contrast to empirical simulations that employ a specific set of historical returns, proprietary risk models, and multiple constraints. These analytic solutions reveal precisely how various kinds of predicted risk affect the relative magnitude of security weights in each type of risk-based portfolio construction.</description><author>Clarke, Roger; de Silva, Harindra; Thorley, Steven</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2013 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Size Rotation in the US Equity Market</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Miller, Keith L.; Ooi, Chee; Li, Hong; Giamouridis, Daniel
In this article, Miller, Ooi, Lee, and Giamouridis develop a hybrid model that relies on the nonlinear classification decision tree (DT) approach, and also on multivariate predictive regressions, to help implement a size rotation strategy in the U.S. equity markets. They derive an investment prediction with a two-stage algorithm. In the first stage, they use a decision tree to determine whether large-cap or small-cap stocks will outperform in the subsequent quarter. In the second stage, the authors use a multiple linear regression model to predict whether large-cap stocks will outperform or underperform small-cap stocks in the next quarter. A binary variable obtained from the first stage of the analysis-the DT model-is a key variable in the second-stage model. The authors find that a size rotation strategy based on the proposed hybrid model outperforms strategies based on the constituent models, as well as alternative strategies investigated in other studies.</description><author>Miller, Keith L.; Ooi, Chee; Li, Hong; Giamouridis, Daniel</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2013 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Book-to-Market and the Cross-Section of Expected Returns in International Stock Markets</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Bali, Turan G.; Cakici, Nusret; Fabozzi, Frank J.
Individual stocks' expected return estimates are a key input for equity selection models. A 2008 study by Eugene Fama and Kenneth French found evidence that past changes in book equity and price contain independent information about expected cash flows that can be used to improve estimates of expected returns. This study focuses on international stock markets and re-examines whether the origins of the book-to-market ratio (BM), in terms of past changes in book equity and price, enhance the estimates of expected returns provided by BM alone. Examining all stocks, as well as subcategories of microcap, small, large, and all-but-microcap stocks trading in the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Italy, Canada, and Japan, the authors find that recent changes in book equity and price are more relevant than more distant changes in enhancing estimates of expected future cash flows and expected future returns. Their tests also show that changes in book equity say much more about expected stock returns than price changes do.</description><author>Bali, Turan G.; Cakici, Nusret; Fabozzi, Frank J.</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2013 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Incorporating Linkers in a Global Government Bond Risk Model</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>de Jong, Marielle
Many governments around the world now issue inflation-protected securities, or linkers, alongside conventional nominal bonds. This extends the fixed-income investment universe. Investors may not know how to build these new securities into a bond-risk model that captures overall global-price covariance. The author studies this question through the international capital asset pricing model approach, which decomposes risk into a global systematic component and a local specific component. The challenge is to fit a linear factor model onto the triangular relationship that exists between the nominal bond yields, the inflation-linked bond yields, and yield spreads called the inflation break-even rates. The author's model provides a consistent view of risk for internationally invested portfolios containing nominal bonds, linkers, and/or inflation swaps.</description><author>de Jong, Marielle</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2013 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Is There Value in Valuation?</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Fridson, Martin; Finnerty, John D.

Young people who buy stock on margin and reduce their equity exposure as they age can reduce lifetime portfolio risk. For example, an initially leveraged portfolio produces the same mean accumulation as a constant 74% stock allocation with a 21% smaller standard deviation. Since the means are equal, the reduced volatility doesn't depend on the equity premium. A leveraged life-cycle strategy also lets investors come closer to their utility-maximizing equity allocation. Monte Carlo simulations show that the gains continue even with equity premiums well below historical levels.</description><author>Ayres, Ian; Nalebuff, Barry</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2013 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>A Constant-Volatility Framework for Managing Tail Risk</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Hocquard, Alexandre; Ng, Sunny; Papageorgiou, Nicolas
Since Lehman Brothers collapsed in 2008, tail-risk hedging has become an increasingly important concern for investors. Traditional approaches, such as purchasing options or variance swaps as insurance, are often expensive, illiquid, and result in a substantial drag on performance. A more prudent, cost-effective way to maintain a constant risk exposure is to actively manage portfolio exposure according to the prevailing volatility level within underlying assets. The authors implement a robust methodology based on Dybvig's payoff distribution model to target a constant level of volatility and normalize monthly returns. This approach to portfolio and risk management can help investors obtain their desired risk exposures over both short and longer time frames, reduce exposure to tail risk, and in general increase portfolios' risk-adjusted performance.</description><author>Hocquard, Alexandre; Ng, Sunny; Papageorgiou, Nicolas</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2013 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Introducing Leverage Aversion into Portfolio Theory and Practice</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Jacobs, Bruce I.; Levy, Kenneth N.

In a multi-factor world, diversification benefits do not generally depend on correlation. Investors can restructure portfolios to align factor sensitivities. This implies that diversification benefits depend only on the idiosyncratic volatility that remains after restructuring. Similarly, the risk reduction that follows adding an asset to an existing portfolio does not depend on the asset's correlation with the portfolio. These implications evince the fundamental importance of measuring the underlying factors and estimating factor sensitivities for every asset. Other researchers have investigated several methods for measuring factors. An easy-to-implement general method involves specifying a group of heterogeneous indexes or traded portfolios. Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) could be well suited to this purpose.</description><author>Roll, Richard</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2013 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Liquidity and Portfolio Choice: A Unified Approach</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Kinlaw, Will; Kritzman, Mark; Turkington, David
The authors propose a simple analytical construct for incorporating liquidity into portfolio choice. In cases where investors deploy liquidity to raise a portfolio's expected utility beyond its original expected utility, the authors attach a shadow asset to tradable assets. In cases where investors deploy liquidity to prevent a portfolio's expected utility from falling, the authors attach a shadow liability to assets that are not tradable. This construct lets investors determine the optimal allocation to illiquid assets. Alternatively, investors can use this construct to estimate the premium an illiquid asset requires, or the degree to which they must benefit from liquidity in order to justify forgoing investment in illiquid assets. This approach improves on other methods of incorporating liquidity into portfolio choice in four fundamental ways. First, it mirrors what actually occurs within a portfolio. Second, it maps units of liquidity onto units of expected return and risk, so that investors can analyze liquidity within the same context as other portfolio decisions. Third, it distinguishes absolute illiquidity from partial illiquidity and lets investors address these attributes within a single, unifying framework. Fourth, it recognizes that liquidity serves not only to meet demands for capital, but to exploit opportunities as well, thus revealing that investors bear an illiquidity cost to the extent that any fraction of a portfolio is immobile.</description><author>Kinlaw, Will; Kritzman, Mark; Turkington, David</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2013 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Digital Portfolios</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Das, Sanjiv R.

These portfolios comprise correlated assets with joint Bernoulli distributions and have substantial skews and kurtosis. The intuitions of mean-variance analysis do not carry over to these portfolios. Using a simple, standard, fast recursion technique to generate a portfolio's return distribution, the author derives investor guidelines for constructing digital-asset portfolios.

Tucker and Laipply quantify the price discovery properties of fixed-income ETFs, focusing in particular on the speed at which the ETF and OTC bond markets reflect new price information. They find that fixed-income ETF price movements can potentially serve as a leading signal for subsequent OTC bond market movements (as proxied by bond market indices), especially when volatility is high.

Investors seek to grow their wealth over time and avoid large draw-downs along the way, but these goals conflict. A policy portfolio serves as an expression of how investors balance these conflicting goals. A policy portfolio that maintains constant asset weights, however, experiences significant inter-temporal disparity in its risk profile, thereby defeating the purpose for which it is intended.

Low-volatility strategies have been shown to offer significant total risk and drawdown reduction without sacrificing returns, compared to the market. However, low-risk strategies also involve an inherent trade-off between total risk and active risk (or tracking error). Existing passive alternatives for capturing low-risk strategies emphasize total risk reduction at the expense of high and uncontrolled active risk. The article discusses a new approach for capturing abnormal risk-related payoffs at targeted active-risk levels, using a transparent, rules-based approach. This proposed approach lets investors strike a better trade-off between total risk and active risk, and implement low-volatility investing within the constraints of their active-risk budgets.</description><author>Ghayur, Khalid; Heaney, Ronan; Platt, Stephen</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2013 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Carrier Portfolios</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Kusiak, Steven
In recent years, the demand for passive investment products in hard-to-replicate asset classes, or exotic betas, has grown faster than financial services firms' capacity to engineer such products. Full replication of exotic betas is usually impossible or too costly. For example, it is particularly difficult to obtain passive exposure to small-cap equity indices or to alternative asset classes, such as private equity with liquid instruments. The carrier portfolio provides a novel response to this outstanding issue. Unlike methods that require a covariance matrix (or factor model) and solve the usual tracking-error quadratic program, the carrier portfolio relies on a linear program that directly takes into account each return observation and minimizes the total absolute exposure of the underlying assets. Hence, the method does not require assumptions about the return data's statistical distribution, is amenable to very large-scale optimization problems involving thousands of assets, and can handle problems for which the number of assets is greater than the number of return observations. As a result, the carrier portfolio tends to better track various financial benchmarks with fewer investment vehicles and simplifies the process of creating such portfolios across large numbers of potential investments.</description><author>Kusiak, Steven</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2013 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Liability-Driven Investment With Downside Risk</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Ang, Andrew; Chen, Bingxu; Sundaresan, Suresh
The authors develop a liability-driven investment framework that incorporates downside risk penalties for not meeting liabilities. The shortfall between the asset and liabilities can be valued as an option that swaps the value of the endogenously determined optimal portfolio for the value of the liabilities. The optimal portfolio selection exhibits endogenous risk aversion and, as the funding ratio deviates from the fully funded case in both directions, effective risk aversion decreases. When funding is low, the manager swings for the fences to take on risk, betting on the chance that liabilities can be covered. Over-funded plans also can afford to take on more risk, as liabilities are already well covered and so invest aggressively in risky securities.</description><author>Ang, Andrew; Chen, Bingxu; Sundaresan, Suresh</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2013 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Option Pricing and Market Efficiency</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Jarrow, Robert
This article dispels the common belief that option pricing and market efficiency are independent concepts, only weakly related at best. It shows that risk-neutral valuation, the standard approach for pricing derivatives, is true if (and only if) the market for the underlying asset is efficient with respect to the information set generating the price process's evolution. The article explores implications of this insight for standard derivative-pricing models, including the need to test for asset price bubbles before using such models.</description><author>Jarrow, Robert</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2013 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Trading Volatility: At What Cost?</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Whaley, Robert E.
Volatility trading is in vogue. Launched in January 2009, exchange-traded products (ETPs) linked to the CBOE Market Volatility Index (VIX) have enamored no small number of traders, judging by the billions of dollars invested in these new products. The reason is unclear. The most popular VIX ETPs are not suitable buy-and-hold investments and are virtually guaranteed to lose money over time. Indeed, since product launch, ETPs linked to the S&amp;P 500 VIX short-term futures indices have chalked up losses of nearly $4 billion. Yet the market continues to grow. This article describes these products, explaining how and why they lose money.</description><author>Whaley, Robert E.</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2013 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Clairvoyant Discount Rates</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Arnott, Robert D.; Li, Feifei; Warren, Geoffrey J.
In 2009, Arnott, Li, and Sherrerd asked how a clairvoyant investor-an investor who can see the future cash flows that a company will deliver to its shareholders and an eventual resale price-would have valued individual stocks. By examining past share prices in the context of subsequent dividends, the authors garnered insights into how well market prices predict future company success (impressively well) and how correctly the market prices growth versus value (impressively badly). This article reverses the analysis, computing the discount rate a clairvoyant investor must accept to justify the current price. The goal is to gain insight into the extent to which variations in expected returns may explain pricing. These "clairvoyant discount rates" fall in a distribution that sheds new light on value and size effects. A shockingly low discount rate, often lower than the cash yield, must apply for the richest growth stocks to justify their historical valuations. The size effect is not driven by a higher average return for small companies, but by a handful of extreme outliers. These results cast doubt on the notion that the size and value effects can be a result of cross-sectional differences in discount rates in an efficient market.</description><author>Arnott, Robert D.; Li, Feifei; Warren, Geoffrey J.</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2013 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Price Discovery: The Economic Function of a Stock Exchange</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Alan, Nazli Sila; Schwartz, Robert A.

Over the course of his six-decade-plus career, Vanguard founder John C. Bogle has witnessed-and been an active participant in-sweeping changes in the mutual fund industry. In the early days, "Boston Trustees" usually managed a single fund, with a focus on the long-term, prudent investment, and stewardship. Today the industry is dominated by giant financial conglomerates running fund supermarkets, focused on short-term, more aggressive strategies, and salesmanship. Four major changes drove this change in the mutual fund culture: 1) The industry's incredible growth. 2) Aggressive, high-risk investment strategies. 3) Product proliferation. And 4) conglomeratization. Yet one innovation stood firm against that rising tide-the index fund. In recent years, investor cash inflows have poured into "passively-managed" index funds while "actively-managed" equity funds have endured substantial outflows.</description><author>Bogle, John C.</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2013 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Portfolio Strategy and Structure Take Center Stage: "How, What, Where, and When?"

Real estate has become more accepted as a basic building block of a well-diversified institutional portfolio over the past decade. The debate around the question "Why Real Estate?" has largely been put to rest. The most relevant research questions about the asset class now revolve around more detailed issues in optimal allocations under different situations and in light of new trends, and also around details of how implementation of a real estate allocation (i.e. the actual investments made) should be done and how it affects the risk/return characteristics of the final portfolio.

Real estate is the third-largest asset class for institutional investors, but research into the performance of pension fund investments in real estate is scant. This article employs a unique set of data, the CEM database, to study the real estate investment approach, cost, and performance for a global panel of almost a thousand pension funds. The results show that smaller pension funds invest primarily in direct real estate, through external managers and fund-of-funds, and are likely to disregard listed property companies in their real estate allocation. Larger pension funds are more likely to invest in real estate internally, exhibit lower costs, and achieve higher net returns. Internal real estate investment management is associated with lower costs and disproportionally higher returns. Finally, we document that U.S. pension plans' real estate investments significantly underperform both their benchmarks and their foreign peers.</description><author>Andonov, Aleksandar; Kok, Nils; Eichholtz, Piet</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Sep 2013 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>After the Fall: Real Estate in the Mixed-Asset Portfolio in the Aftermath of the Global Financial Crisis</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Lizieri, Colin

The wide disagreement between academics and practitioners with regard to the optimal real estate allocation in the mixed-asset portfolio is a long standing puzzle. Extensive research focusing on "fine-tuning" the application of Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) has been unable to reach any consensus. This article develops an alternative portfolio theory that extends the MPT to accommodate the unique characteristics such as (1) real estate is subject to significant liquidity risk, (2) real estate return distribution is not independent and identically-distributed, and (3) real estate has high transaction cost. Using real world data, the model produces optimal real estate allocation that is much lower than previously suggested by the literature and is in fact quite in line with the reality of institutional portfolios.</description><author>Cheng, Ping; Lin, Zhenguo; Liu, Yingchun</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Sep 2013 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>The Price per Pound and Replacement Cost: The Effects of Q on Office Investment</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Nordby, Hans; Taylor, Michael

By using CoStar property and land transaction sale price data and RSMeans construction cost data from 2000 to 2012, the authors are able to construct comprehensive national and market-level Q indices. The results indicate a strong relationship between Q and investment in office properties. The authors also find that this relationship differs across markets and is generally related to the level of barriers to construction present in these markets.</description><author>Nordby, Hans; Taylor, Michael</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Sep 2013 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>A Closer Look at Co-Movements in Global Office Rents</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Suran, Luciana

We find evidence consistent with the hypotheses that i) fund performance is almost directly proportional to the return on the underlying real estate market, ii) there is evidence for systematic underperformance as measured by Jensen's alpha, possibly related to market frictions, iii) leverage cannot be viewed as a long-term strategy to enhance performance, and iv) timing leverage choices to the expected future market environment does not appear to add significantly to fund excess returns.</description><author>Alcock, Jamie; Baum, Andrew; Colley, Nicholas; Steiner, Eva</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Sep 2013 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Commercial Real Estate Risk Management with Derivatives</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Fabozzi, Frank J.; Stanescu, Silvia; Tunaru, Radu

We introduce a methodology to estimate common real estate returns and cycles across public and private real estate markets. We first place REIT indices and direct real estate-NCREIF appraisal-based and transaction-based indices (NPI and NTBI)-on a comparable basis by adjusting for leverage and sector. We extract a common real estate factor, which is allowed to be persistent, from all these markets. Individual real estate indices load on this common factor and they also are driven by persistent, idiosyncratic shocks. The common real estate factor is procyclical and has low correlations with standard systematic factors from public markets. Short-run idiosyncratic deviations from the common real estate factor load on several capital market factors for REITs and on liquidity factors for direct real estate.</description><author>Ang, Andrew; Nabar, Neil; Wald, Samuel J.</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Sep 2013 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Securitization and the Supply Cycle: Evidence from the REIT Market</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Packer, Frank; Riddiough, Timothy; Shek, Jimmy
We analyze securitized equity interests in commercial property (the so-called listed REIT market), with a particular focus on the U.S. experience. We begin by observing that there is a strong negative relationship between new commercial property construction activity and the growth of the U.S. REIT market. Based on this and other relevant factors, we conjecture that an important reason for the muted commercial property supply response during the early and mid-2000s was the "civilizing influence" of the REIT sector. A formal test of the conjecture suggests that the REIT market indeed moderated supply outcomes in the U.S. Relationships between the REIT market and new construction activity are generally weaker in other analyzed countries, where we attribute these findings to structural differences. We conclude that attention to structural detail is essential in order to maximize the benefits associated with creating a transparent and liquid market for securitized investment interests.</description><author>Packer, Frank; Riddiough, Timothy; Shek, Jimmy</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Sep 2013 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Assessing the Impact of Real Estate on Target Date Fund Performance</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Esrig, Dave; Kolasa, Susan; Cerreta, Luigi

Managed volatility strategies adjust asset allocation dynamically in anticipation of, or in response to extreme market volatility. This implies that during periods of market stress, investors can rebalance to a risk budget as an investment policy option, rather than strictly adhering to current practices that rebalance back to fixed portfolio weights. We measure the advantages of managed volatility with a multi-period model and find that the benefits increase with an investor's ability to forecast market volatility beyond historical relationships. The practical application for investors is that a more flexible and dynamic investment policy may result in better investment outcomes.</description><author>Dopfel, Frederick E.; Ramkumar, Sunder R.</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2013 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Are Risk-Parity Managers at Risk Parity?</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Qian, Edward
Risk parity has become an accepted investment strategy, to some degree. Its main advantage is its use of risk allocation, as opposed to the capital allocation used by the traditional asset allocation approach. A balanced risk allocation provides true diversification; therefore risk parity should deliver better risk-adjusted return over time. Despite the acceptance and the fact that the term "risk parity" has been in use for almost ten years, the investment community seems confused about risk parity's true definition. Is it just a quantitative risk-budgeting technique? Is it about operational leverage? Or is it about high exposures to fixed income and low exposures to equities? In this paper, the author aims to define the principle of risk parity investing. He then examines a sample of risk parity managers, using the return-based style analysis pioneered by William Sharpe. The results show that, according to the defined principle, a number of risk parity managers in our sample are not using true risk parity.</description><author>Qian, Edward</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2013 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Is Markowitz Wrong?

Diversification is famously referred to as the only "free lunch" in investing, but it has been under assault since the 2007-2009 global financial crisis, when virtually all long-only asset classes moved down together. Ilmanen and Kizer argue that the attacks are undeserved. Most investors were never as diversified as they thought they were, and there is ample room for improvement by shifting the focus from asset class diversification to factor diversification. They show that diversification into and across factors has been much more effective in reducing portfolio volatility and market directionality than asset class diversification. The benefits are greatest for long short investing, which requires shorting and leverage but are also meaningful in a long-only context.</description><author>Ilmanen, Antti; Kizer, Jared</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jan 2012 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Risk On/Risk Off</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Lee, Wai

Although his results do not provide guidance on the interpolation between a given state and the extreme state of perfect correlation, Lee believes that his analysis can serve as a compass for the investment decision-making process in the event that investors believe the market is moving toward or away from a risk-on/risk-off environment.

Garcia-Feijoo, Jensen, and Johnson evaluate the effectiveness of several asset classes in the hedging of portfolio risk over the 1970-2010 period. Of the alternative assets examined, commodities offer the greatest diversification potential due to their very low correlation with stock and bond returns. Furthermore, while the diversification benefits of many asset classes diminish during periods of extreme market movements, the benefits of commodities remain strong. Overall, they find robust support for the hedging potential of commodities, but they present three caveats to this view. First, relative to the other commodities, industrial metals offer much less diversification potential for equity investors. Second, commodities serve as considerably more effective hedges during periods when Federal Reserve monetary policy is tight (i.e., when inflationary concerns are elevated). Third, relative to the other commodities, precious metals provide equity investors with a more consistent hedge across alternative inflationary environments.</description><author>Garcia-Feijoo, Luis; Jensen, Gerald R.; Johnson, Robert R.</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jan 2012 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Demystifying Equity Risk-Based Strategies: A Simple Alpha plus Beta Description</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>de Carvalho, Raul Leote; Lu, Xiao; Moulin, Pierre
In this article, de Carvalho, Lu, and Moulin consider five risk-based strategies: equally weighted, equal-risk budget, equal-risk contribution, minimum variance, and maximum diversification. All five strategies can be well described by exposure to the market-cap index and to four simple factors: low beta, small cap, low residual volatility, and value.This finding, in their view, is a major contribution to the understanding of such strategies and provides a simple framework to compare them. All except the equal-weighted strategy are defensive and have lower volatility than the market-cap index. Equal-weighted is exposed to small-cap stocks. Equal-risk budget and equal-risk contribution are exposed to small-cap and to low-beta stocks.These three have a high correlation of excess returns, and their portfolios largely overlap.Their portfolios invest in all stocks available and have both a low turnover and low tracking error relative to the market-cap index. The minimum variance and maximum diversification strategies primarily have exposure to low-beta stocks.These two strategies are the most defensive, invest in much the same stocks, and have high tracking error and turnover.</description><author>de Carvalho, Raul Leote; Lu, Xiao; Moulin, Pierre</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jan 2012 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Diversifying the Diversifiers and Tracking the Tracking Error: Outperforming Cap-Weighted Indices with Limited Risk of Underperformance</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Amenc, Noel; Goltz, Felix; Lodh, Ashish; Martellini, Lionel
A number of quantitative or fundamental weighting schemes have been shown to produce robust outperformance with respect to standard cap-weighted equity indices over long time periods. Over periods ranging from a few months to a few years, however, such alternative weighting schemes can generate substantial downside risk relative to cap-weighted indices, which would be a source of concern for most investment managers or chief investment officers. In this article, the authors focus on two reasonable proxies for well-diversified, efficient frontier portfolios, namely, the maximum Sharpe ratio (MSR) portfolio and the global minimum volatility (GMV) portfolio. They address the question of how to use these building blocks to design an improved equity benchmark while satisfying target levels of average and extreme tracking error with respect to cap-weighted indices.The authors find that robust proxies for the GMV portfolio provide defensive exposure to equity that does well in adverse market conditions, while robust proxies for MSR portfolios provide greater access to the upside of equity markets. Because the relative performance of these two diversification approaches depends on market conditions, they expect a combination of both approaches to lead to a smoother conditional performance and higher probability of outperformance of the cap-weighted index, an intuition that is confirmed in empirical tests. Empirical analysis also suggests that "diversifying the diversifiers" still leads to high levels of relative downside risk, in particular when the performance of cap-weighted indices is unusually strong. In this context, the authors introduce an explicit relative risk control mechanism designed to reduce the consequences of severe short-term underperformance with respect to the cap-weighted index and confirm through out-of-sample empirical tests that "tracking the tracking error" would allow investors to achieve better access to outperformance per unit of extreme relative risk taken. Overall, the results reported in this article suggest that it is possible to achieve robust outperformance versus cap-weighted indices by diversifying model risk and by controlling relative risk compared to the cap-weighted indices.</description><author>Amenc, Noel; Goltz, Felix; Lodh, Ashish; Martellini, Lionel</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jan 2012 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>What's Wrong with Today's Economics? The Current Crisis Calls for an Approach to Economics Rooted More on Data Than on Rationality</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Focardi, Sergio M.; Fabozzi, Frank J.
Focardi and Fabozzi argue that current mainstream economics is not a science in the sense of the physical sciences, and they draw some conclusions from the point of view of asset management. Their key point is that economics as embodied in the general equilibrium theories describes an idealized rational economic world as opposed to one based on empirical data. Although this argument has already been made, it has been virtually ignored by economists.The current crisis, however, requires an economic understanding anchored on a solid empirical basis. The authors review a number of facts, including the following: 1) market efficiency is a quantitative concept, with efficiency defined in terms of the magnitude of realistic profit opportunities; 2) the dynamic vector-like nature of inflation challenges current theories about inflation and the generation of money, making growth path-dependent; 3) economic conservation laws are key to understanding growth; and 4) a market economy cannot support an unbounded level of wealth and income inequality because they become a destabilizing factor. The overall lesson for asset management is that economics matters and that the culture of pure speculation would be replaced profitably for society as a whole with a true culture of investment.</description><author>Focardi, Sergio M.; Fabozzi, Frank J.</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jan 2012 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Diversification Return and Leveraged Portfolios</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Qian, Edward
It is widely accepted that portfolio rebalancing adds diversification return to fixed-weight portfolios, but this is only true for long-only unleveraged portfolios. Qian provides analytical results regarding portfolio rebalancing and the associated diversification returns for different kinds of portfolios including long-only, long-short, and leveraged. He shows that portfolio rebalancing is linked to underlying portfolio dynamics. For long-only unleveraged portfolios, rebalancing amounts to a mean-reverting strategy, and the diversification return is always non-negative. But for short (or inverse) and leveraged portfolios, portfolio rebalancing on the top-down level amounts to a trend-following strategy that detracts from diversification return. Qian analyzes diversification returns of risk parity portfolios and shows that the diversification return of a leveraged long-only portfolio can generally be decomposed into two parts, both of which are related to a scaled unleveraged portfolio. The first part is the positive diversification return from rebalancing among individual assets at the bottom-up level, which is amplified by leverage. The second part is the negative diversification return caused by the leverage of the overall portfolio. His numerical examples show that diversification return is, in general, positive for leveraged risk parity portfolios when the leverage ratio is not too high. In addition, he shows that low correlations between different assets are crucial in achieving positive diversification return and reducing portfolio turnover for risk parity portfolios.</description><author>Qian, Edward</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jan 2012 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Asset Owners versus Asset Managers: Agency Costs and Asymmetries of Information in Alternative Assets</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Anson, Mark
Agency theory is about striking the right balance between principals and their agents. In any agency relationship, the motives and desires of the agent may be different from that of the principal. For public corporations, agency theory is often called corporate governance. There is a growing awareness, however, that agency theory also applies to the investment management industry in which asset owners delegate the caretaking of their investments to asset managers. The potential misalignment of interests between asset owners and asset managers can lead to four agency costs: asymmetry of skill or alpha, asymmetry of incentives, asymmetry of liquidity, and asymmetry of risk taking.</description><author>Anson, Mark</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jan 2012 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Analysts' Earnings Forecast, Recommendation, and Target Price Revisions</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Feldman, Ronen; Livnat, Joshua; Zhang, Yuan
This study examines the immediate and delayed market responses to revisions in analyst forecasts of earnings, target prices, and recommendations. Consistent with prior literature, revisions in earnings forecasts are positively and significantly associated with short-term market returns around the revisions. However, Feldman, Livnat, and Zhang show that short-term market returns around target price revisions and recommendation changes are even stronger.

Gergaud and Ziemba discuss the records of some great investors and hedge fund managers. The investors' graphs of wealth over time lead to a search for smooth monotone paths and a fair way to evaluate superior as opposed to average investors. Some investors prefer high long-run growth and accept bumps rather than smooth wealth paths and lower growth. These include some Kelly criterion investors such as Buffett, Keynes, and Soros who have concentrated portfolios with few asset positions. In 2005 Ziemba proposed a modification, following an earlier proposal by Ziemba and Schwartz in 1991, of the ordinary normal distribution based Sharpe ratio to evaluate right-skewed great investor portfolios. This measure only counts losses and is useful in evaluating superior investors such as the Renaissance Medallion hedge fund, which has a high rating by the modified downside symmetric Sharpe ratio (DSSR) as opposed to having only a modest rating with the ordinary Sharpe ratio. Using the University of Massachusetts hedge fund database, Gergaud and Ziemba discuss some funds with superior records and from their evaluation learn more about the properties of the DSSR. and the modified downside symmetric information ratio.</description><author>Gergaud, Olivier; Ziemba, William T.</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jan 2012 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Naked Short Selling and Market Returns</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Boulton, Thomas J.; Braga-Alves, Marcus V.
Boulton and Braga-Alves study persistent failures to deliver (fails) to better understand naked short sellers' trading strategies, their ability to profit from their trades, and the market's reaction to information about their activities. Contrary to recent claims that naked short sellers are momentum traders who drive down stock prices, they find that returns are typically positive just prior to periods of increased naked short selling that result in persistent fails and that returns generally remain positive for several weeks afterward. Their results also suggest that stocks that experience persistent fails are susceptible to short squeezes as shares move from a normal state in which short exposure is established by borrowing and selling to a hard-to-borrow state in which fails become a more attractive option for establishing short exposure.</description><author>Boulton, Thomas J.; Braga-Alves, Marcus V.</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jan 2012 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Quantifying the Variance Risk Premium in VIX Options</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Barnea, Amir; Hogan, Reed

They supplement the dynamic Nelson-Siegel model with the Federal Reserve's Survey of Professional Forecasters data. Because these data utilize information from dozens of professional forecasters who study numerous macroeconomic variables, the author's wanted to see if this information-rich supplementary data could be used to improve the interest rate forecasting models for out-of-sample forecasts for Treasury bond maturities ranging from three months to 10 years that extend from three months to one year into the future.</description><author>Francis, Jack Clark; Hua, Jian</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jan 2012 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>An Empirical Analysis of Exchange-Traded Funds</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Buetow, Gerald W.; Henderson, Brian J.
Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) provide investors with a single, tradable security for gaining exposure to an index that presumably proxies for an asset class. In the U.S. alone, ETF assets under management have grown to nearly $900 billion. Buetow and Henderson analyze ETF returns to evaluate how closely ETF prices replicate exposures to their benchmark indices. The authors' analysis highlights practical considerations that influence index replication. On average, an ETF closely tracks its benchmark index. An ETF that tracks an index composed of less liquid securities exhibits a larger tracking error, and an ETF that tracks an index composed of less liquid, or non-U.S., securities exhibits a greater correlation (relative to the benchmark index) with a U.S. equity index, suggesting that the diversification benefits of these ETFs are less than is implied by the return properties of the benchmark index.</description><author>Buetow, Gerald W.; Henderson, Brian J.</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jan 2012 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Hunting for Alpha Hunters in the Currency Jungle</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Pojarliev, Momtchil; Levich, Richard M.

Investors care about systemic them to events importance because this knowledge may enable assess their portfolio's vulnerability to particular and, if warranted, to pursue defensive strategies. Policymakers also need this information to ensure that policies and regulations target the appropriate entities and to more effectively engage in preventive or corrective measures when circumstances warrant intervention. The absorption ratio, introduced by Kritzman, Li, Page, and Rigobon in 2011, provides an implied measure of systemic risk based on principal component analysis. The authors extend this methodology to determine an entity's centrality. Their centrality measure captures an entity's vulnerability to failure, its connectivity to other entities, and the risk of the entities to which it is connected. They convert this measure of centrality into a measure of systemic importance by conditioning it on periods of high systemic risk.</description><author>Kinlaw, Will; Kritzman, Mark; Turkington, David</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jan 2012 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>The Norway Model</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Chambers, David; Dimson, Elroy; Ilmanen, Antti

Dupleich Ulloa, Giamouridis, and Montagu investigate the potential improvement in the implementation of style rotation strategies by techniques addressing estimation errors. They select two approaches that have recently stood out in the statistics and econometrics literature and have been applied to portfolio construction. One approach builds on regularization methods, addressing estimation error by focusing on the weights of the constructed portfolios. The second method pools forecasts that are obtained across different observation windows, thus focusing on minimizing estimation error in the moments of the return distribution that may arise due to structural breaks. The authors conclude that overall benefits are derived by foregoing naive approaches, which in their dataset can be as significant as an improvement in the Information Ratio of about 54%; that is, improving from 0.65 (naive) to approximately 1 (dynamic).</description><author>Ulloa, M.

Cauwels and Sornette present a novel methodology to determine the fundamental value of firms in the social networking sector, motivated by recent realized IPOs and by reports that suggest sky-high valuations of firms such as Facebook, Groupon, LinkedIn Corp., Pandora Media, Inc., Twitter, and Zynga. The authors' valuation of these firms is based on two assumptions: 1) revenues and profits of a social networking firm are inherently linked to its user base through a direct channel that has no equivalent in other sectors, and 2) the growth in the number of users can be calibrated with standard logistic growth models, which allows for reliable extrapolations of the size of the business at long time horizons. Cauwels and Sornette illustrate the methodology with a detailed analysis of Facebook, one of the biggest of the social media giants. A clear signature of a change of regime, occurring in 2010 in the growth of the number of users, is observed. The change of regime is a move from a pure exponential behavior (a paradigm for unlimited growth) to a logistic function with asymptotic plateau (a paradigm for growth in competition). The authors consider three different scenarios: a base case, high-growth, and extreme-growth scenario. Using a discount factor of 5%, a profit margin of 29% and $3.50 of revenues per user per year yields a value of Facebook of $15.3 billion in the base case scenario, $20.2 billion in the high-growth scenario, and $32.9 billion in the extreme-growth scenario. According to the authors' methodology, this implies that Facebook needs to increase its profit per user before the IPO by a factor of 3 to 6 in the base case scenario, 2.5 to 5 in the high-growth scenario, and 1.5 to 3 in the extreme-growth scenario in order to meet the current, widespread high expectations. To prove the wider applicability of their methodology, the analysis is repeated for Groupon, the well-known deal-of-the-day website, that went public in November 2011. The results are in line with the Facebook analysis. Customer growth will plateau. By not taking this fundamental property of the growth process into consideration, estimates of the Facebook IPO are wildly overpriced.</description><author>Cauwels, Peter; Sornette, Didier</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jan 2012 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Can Investing in Volatility Help Meet Your Portfolio Objectives?</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Warren, Geoffrey J.
Warren evaluates investing in volatility products under a range of investor objectives, including risk and return at the total portfolio level, benchmark-relative performance, and liability-aware investing. He shows that the potential role for volatility exposure depends on investor circumstances. Long positions in forward variance swaps or longer-dated VIX futures can be effective for hedging equity-related risk within balanced portfolios, but do so at the cost of exacerbating benchmark-relative risk and may be of limited benefit in certain liability-aware situations. Investors best placed to capture the volatility risk premium through shorting volatility include those with higher tolerance for total portfolio and benchmark-relative risk, longer investment horizons, or interest rate sensitive liabilities.</description><author>Warren, Geoffrey J.</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jan 2012 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>The Alpha and Beta of Risk Attribution</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Davis, Ben; Menchero, Jose

The authors show that by following this methodology, drilldowns into tracking error at any level of granularity can be neatly decomposed into parallel alpha and beta drilldowns. They also show that factor-based risk attribution represents an important special case of the alpha and beta risk decomposition, and they demonstrate that the residual exposure-based analysis of residual risk is prone to counterintuitive attribution effects.</description><author>Davis, Ben; Menchero, Jose</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jan 2012 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Fooled by Compounding</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>McLean, R.

Compounding can make things appear to be larger than they really are.

In this article, McLean reviews several examples of this common mistake, which are found in a popular book on rare events, newspaper articles, investment advisors' research reports, and finance journal articles. He also shows how compounding can distort inference in event studies and in the measurement of mutual fund performance. McLean describes alternative methods of return measurement that are not affected by compounding and shows that these methods can lead to different inferences than do measures that include compounding.</description><author>McLean, R.

In this article, Jacobs, Karagozoglu, and Naples Layish focus on determining which types of firms are able to successfully remain independent entities through the resolution of their financial distress. The authors empirically investigate the determinants of the process utilized to resolve financial distress (private work-out versus public bankruptcy filing) and also the outcome (liquidation versus reorganization). After developing various qualitative-dependent variable models, they estimate and compare several accounting and economic variables measured at the time of default that they expect can influence the resolution process and outcome. Results reveal the ordered logistic regression specification achieves the best balance between in-sample fit, consistency with financial theory, and out-of-sample classification accuracy, as compared to more elaborate techniques, such as local regression or neural networks. The authors find the public resolution process to be associated with larger firms that have less tangibility, a greater proportion of secured debt in their capital structures, or higher risk measures. The private resolution process is likelier for firms that have more total leverage, greater measures of liquidity a higher proportion of subordinated debt in their capital structures, or reside in a debtor-friendly bankruptcy court district. Regarding the resolution outcome, the authors find that firms that are more likely to be liquidated than reorganized have greater liquidity, more secured debt, lower cumulative abnormal returns on equity, higher loss given default, a less favorable auditor's opinion, or they will default in a better part of the credit cycle. Finally, firms more likely to be reorganized have greater leverage, more intangible assets, or a prepackaged bankruptcy. They conclude that their model is useful for risk managers and investors who are in the market for distressed or defaulted debt.</description><author>Jacobs, Michael; Karagozoglu, Ahmet K.; Layish, Dina Naples</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jan 2012 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Jumps and Cojumps in Subprime Home Equity Derivatives</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Mizrach, Bruce

Previous research provides evidence that much of the cross-sectional variation in equity returns can be explained by firm characteristics or sectors. One popular money management technique is to construct a portfolio (fund) using other managed portfolios (funds).The resulting overall portfolio is generally referred to as a fund-of-funds portfolio. This study by Larsen and Resnick demonstrates the potential for performance enhancement in a fund of funds when portfolio optimization techniques are employed on sector funds in order to construct the overall fund. Notably, ex ante optimization over sector funds that are constructed on the basis of market capitalization, price-to-earnings ratios, change in operating earnings, and book-to-market ratios demonstrates the potential for enhancing an overall equity fund performance relative to value-weighted and equal-weighted benchmark portfolios that are constructed from the population of stocks from which the sector portfolios are formed.</description><author>Larsen, Glen A.; Resnick, Bruce G.</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jan 2012 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Factor Alignment Problems and Quantitative Portfolio Management</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Ceria, Sebastian; Saxena, Anureet; Stubbs, Robert A.
Quantitative equity portfolio management has evolved into an interdisciplinary activity that draws expertise from the fields of finance, statistics, econometrics, accounting, and optimization. Each one of these streams is a mature discipline in itself, having its own body of knowledge, and operates under assumptions that are usually well accepted within the respective communities. But when concepts from these diverse fields are applied in a common setting, there is bound to be friction among various assumptions that get further magnified due to the use of an optimizer. In this article, Ceria, Saxena, and Stubbs focus on the interaction of three key elements that are part of the quantitative portfolio management process, namely the expected returns model, the risk model, and the constraints that are used to formulate the portfolio construction problem. They generally refer to the issues caused by this interaction as factor alignment problems. The authors present a detailed investigation of these alignment problems, survey some of their common sources, analyze and document their effects on the ex post performance of optimized portfolios, and conclude with a practical and effective remedy in the form of augmented risk models.</description><author>Ceria, Sebastian; Saxena, Anureet; Stubbs, Robert A.</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jan 2012 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Measuring and Modeling Execution Cost and Risk</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Engle, Robert; Ferstenberg, Robert; Russell, Jeffrey
Financial markets arc considered to be liquid if a large quantity can be traded quickly and with minimal price impact. Although the idea of a liquid market involves both a cost as well as a time component, most measures of execution costs tend to focus on only a single number that reflects average costs and do not explicitly account for the temporal dimension of liquidity In practice, trading takes time because larger orders are often broken up into smaller transactions or because of price limits. Recent work shows that the time taken to transact introduces a risk component in execution costs. In this setting, the decision can be viewed as a risk reward trade-off faced by the investor who can solve for a mean-variance utility-maximizing trading strategy. Engle, Ferstenberg, and Russell introduce an econometric method to jointly model the expected cost and risk of the trade, thereby characterizing the mean-variance tradeoffs associated with different trading approaches, given market and order characteristics. They apply their methodology to a novel dataset and show that the risk component is a nontrivial part of the transaction decision.</description><author>Engle, Robert; Ferstenberg, Robert; Russell, Jeffrey</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jan 2012 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Two Things about Performance Fees</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Kritzman, Mark

What should one do with investment-grade bonds that begin to trade at distressed levels? This is when a portfolio manager is compelled to make the critical decision: Sell, hold, or buy? To help managers make an objective decision, the authors carefully examine the historical evidence regarding the performance of distressed investment-grade (DIG) bonds after a distress month. The historical record shows that DIG bonds have been very strong performers. On average, the 901 DIG bonds from January 1990 to July 2011 returned 51.6% over the 24 months following their distress month. They outperformed their peers by 30.1% and earned 39.8% more than comparable Treasury bonds. After adjusting for DIG bonds' ex ante higher expected excess return volatility, the authors find that DIG bonds generated approximately 81 bps a month of additional return compared with an equal risk investment in the IG Corporate Index.</description><author>Edelstein, Ariel; Phelps, Bruce D.</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jan 2012 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Behavioral Finance 2.0</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Jones, Bob

The exceptional rise in government deficits following the subprime crisis, the recent commodity price spikes, and the increase in inflation volatility have revived the debate on medium- to long-term resurgence of inflation. Using a vector-autoregressive model, Briere and Signori investigate the relationships between asset returns and inflation and the optimal strategic asset allocation for investors seeking to hedge inflation risk in two types of macroeconomic regimes. In a volatile macroeconomic environment marked by countercyclical supply shocks, the asset classes of cash, inflation-linked bonds, and precious metals play an essential role. In a more stable environment, such as what has been called the "Great Moderation," characterized by procyclical demand shocks, the asset classes of cash and nominal bonds play the most significant role, followed by precious metals, real estate, and equities. An ambitious investor in terms of required real returns should have a larger weighting in equities, real estate, and precious metals.</description><author>Briere, Marie; Signori, Ombretta</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jan 2012 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Rebalancing and the Value Effect</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Chaves, Denis B.; Arnott, Robert D.
It is amply documented that a value portfolio outperforms a growth portfolio over long spans in most markets worldwide; less well known, however, is how this outperformance is achieved. Decomposing the total returns of these strategies, Chaves and Arnott find that 1) value portfolios enjoy higher dividend income and 2) the average growth stock enjoys faster dividend growth than the average value stock, but surprisingly 3) value portfolios experience higher growth in dividends than growth portfolios. The authors argue that the first two findings are expected, but the third is not completely understood by investors. The third finding is a consequence of the nature of the rebalance rules for growth and value portfolios. Each rebalance replaces lower-yielding value stocks with new higher-yielding value stocks and replaces higher-yielding growth stocks with new lower-yielding growth stocks. It is, therefore, the act of rebalancing and reconstituting the growth and value portfolios that increases the growth rate for dividend income in value strategies and rather sharply reduces it in the case of growth strategies. Although this finding is analogous to that of Fama and French, which is reported in their 2007 "Migration" paper, Chaves and Arnott more specifically attribute much of the advantage of value strategies to the acts of reconstituting and rebalancing and their side effects on dividends. In so doing, they shed some light on the faster dividend growth of value portfolios.</description><author>Chaves, Denis B.; Arnott, Robert D.</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jan 2012 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Value Premium Across Countries</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Kim, Daehwan
The value premium varies substantially across countries. Kim explores whether the inter-country cross-sectional variation in the value premium can be predicted by the variables known to predict the intra-country time-variation in the value premium. After examining data from 23 developed markets and 13 emerging markets between 2000 and 2010, he found that the earnings-yield spread and the return dispersion have predictive power in emerging markets but not in developed markets. The earnings-growth spread was found to have no significant predictive power.</description><author>Kim, Daehwan</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jan 2012 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Dynamic Exposure Targeting</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Sneddon, Leigh; Yukhymuk, Vyacheslav
Achieving desired exposures to information sources is critical to successful active investing. If a portfolio manager, for example, wants to increase her portfolio's exposure to a signal-how long will it take? By how much should she change the signal's weight? How will exposures to other signals change? If she turns off a signal, for how long will the exposure to it persist? Can she accelerate these shifts? These challenges can present themselves whenever markets or business conditions change. Rule-of-thumb answers can mislead as exposures are affected not only by the sequence of weight changes but also by signal speeds and correlations and by the levels of risk and turnover. Sneddon and Yukhymuk solve for the combined effects of portfolio and signal dynamics, derive explicit predictions of the resulting exposure dynamics, and provide the intuition behind these results. The solutions include cost control as well as expectations over all realizations of the signals, both current and prior. A simple but central result describes exposure shift speeds. The authors show that interactions between different features can lead to unexpected results. The information presented in this article can help a portfolio manager to predict and manage the timing and extent of a portfolio's exposure to its information sources.</description><author>Sneddon, Leigh; Yukhymuk, Vyacheslav</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jan 2012 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Market Risk, Size, Style, Momentum, and Dividends: U.S. Equities</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Gupta, Francis

The aging of the baby boom generation has focused investor attention on the issue of how changing demographics will affect the economy generally and the stock market specifically. One commonly expressed view is that stock returns will be depressed as baby boomers liquidate their portfolios to fund retirement. In this article, Cornell returns to basic theories of economic growth and asset pricing to disentangle the various ways in which demographics can affect future economic growth and future stock returns. He concludes that whereas the aging of the baby boom generation is indeed bad news for future economic growth, in particular, on a per capita basis, it is unlikely to lead to lower future stock returns.</description><author>Cornell, Bradford</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jan 2012 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>The Volume Clock: Insights into the High-Frequency Paradigm</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Easley, David; de Prado, Marcos M.

Over the last two centuries, technological advantages have allowed some traders to be faster than others. In this article, the authors argue that contrary to popular perception, speed is not the defining characteristic that sets high-frequency trading (HFT) apart. HFT is the natural evolution of a new trading paradigm that is characterized by strategic decisions made in a volume-clock metric. Even if the speed advantage disappears, HFT will evolve to continue exploiting structural weaknesses of low-frequency trading (LFT). LFT practitioners are not defenseless against HFT players, however, and this article offers options that can help them survive and adapt to this new environment.</description><author>Easley, David; de Prado, Marcos M.

The concept of diversification is central in finance and has become even more so since the 2008 financial crisis. In this article, the authors introduce a new measure for diversification. The measure, referred to as "diversification delta," is nonparametric, based on higher moments, easily interpretable due to its mathematical formulation, and incorporates the advantages of the present measures of diversification while extending them. The measure is applied to infrastructure returns data in order to understand the benefits of diversifying across various infrastructure classes, gaining useful insights for infrastructure fund managers and investors.</description><author>Vermorken, Maximilian A.; Medda, Francesca R.; Schroeder, Thomas</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jan 2012 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Advancing Strategic Asset Allocation in a Multi-Factor World</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Asl, Farshid M.; Etula, Erkko
Strategic asset allocation is arguably one of the most important, yet least advanced, aspects of investing. The authors present a new approach to strategic asset allocation that leverages the idea that long-term investment returns derive from multiple distinct sources that they call "return-generating factors." Their approach addresses four key shortcomings of traditional approaches: First, their multi-factor model helps better understand the important sources of return in today's complex investment universe, generating a substantial increase in estimation precision across asset classes and providing investors with a new way to think about portfolio diversification. Second, their robust portfolio optimization methodology seeks to explicitly account for the uncertainties inherent in the estimates of expected returns, delivering well-diversified portfolios with superior risk return characteristics. Third, the factor-based risk analytics better capture the true characteristics of asset returns, such as fat tails and increased correlations at times of crises, allowing the authors to more-accurately model the downside risks of portfolios. Finally, the factor-based simulation technique accounts for the impact of different economic conditions (e.g., low interest rates) on future portfolio returns, resulting in more-precise, forward-looking projections.</description><author>Asl, Farshid M.; Etula, Erkko</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jan 2012 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Factor-Timing Model</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Hua, Ronald; Kantsyrev, Dmitri; Qian, Edward

Balancing the tradeoff between in-sample precision and complexity of the problem is the central theme of the considered methodology.

This article clarifies that methodological choices can be made independently for two steps in the construction of alternative equity index strategies: the constituent selection and choice of a diversification-based weighting scheme. By flexibly combining the different possible choices for these steps, the authors create a large variety of strategies and test their performance and risk results. The results suggest that diversification approaches may be a superior alternative, or at least a very important complement, to pure stock selection approaches when it comes to reaching a risk return objective. Moreover, even though some argue that the risk and performance of diversification-based weighting schemes are solely driven by factor tilts, the authors show how straightforward it is to correct such tilts through the selection of stocks with appropriate characteristics while maintaining the improvement in achieving a risk return objective that is due to the respective diversification approaches.</description><author>Amenc, Noel; Goltz, Felix; Lodh, Ashish</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jan 2012 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Analyzing Valuation Measures: A Performance Horse Race over the Past 40 Years</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Gray, Wesley R.; Vogel, Jack

They find that EBITDA/TEV has been the best performing metric, historically, and outperforms many investor favorites, such as price-to-earnings ratio, free cash flow to total enterprise value, and book-to-market ratio. The authors also explore the investment potential of long-term valuation ratios, which replace one-year earnings with an average of long-term earnings. They find that in contrast to prior empirical work, long-tern ratios add little investment value over standard one-year valuation metrics.</description><author>Gray, Wesley R.; Vogel, Jack</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jan 2012 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Economic Profitability and the Valuation of the Firm</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Cruise, Bill
Many discounted cash flow models produce estimates of firm value that are implicitly based upon economically implausible perpetual forecasts of firm profitability. This discrepancy arises because standard free cash flow models leave operating profits and capital levels as free parameters. In this article, the author develops a simple model that explicitly incorporates firms' steady-state returns on invested capital into the valuation equation, thereby addressing the free-parameter problem. He provides evidence that capital growth rates are historically less volatile than free cash flow growth rates and are more useful for accurately predicting firm value within the small sample sizes typically found in practice. With several empirical tests comparing his presented model to commonly used valuation models, the author demonstrates that together these contributions result in improved accuracy and variability of valuation estimates, leading to a new method of discounted cash flow analysis that is more robust and more accurate than other commonly employed alternatives.</description><author>Cruise, Bill</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jan 2012 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>The Myth of the Monkey</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Snigaroff, Robert

Although researchers have studied efficiency via competition across firms, a more general definition of market efficiency is where the industry total product reaches a maximum. Market efficiency has little to do with managers' average excess returns-that is, whether managers beat an index.

The objective of this research was to assess whether forward returns implied by real estate derivative prices provide a more accurate measure of future real estate returns than a consensus forecast of industry experts. Implied returns derived from real estate derivative prices are often used by industry participants as forecasts of future returns, even though the theoretical justification for this is limited. Bond and Mitchell's analysis suggests that since the introduction of real estate derivatives in the U.K., real estate derivatives prices have provided a better indication of future returns than a consensus forecast. But most of this apparent superior performance can be attributed to publication delays with the consensus forecasts. When adjusted for publication delay, the information content of real estate derivatives is shown to be remarkably similar to the consensus forecasts. The authors also caution that as the market for real estate derivatives develops, a greater divergence may emerge between market forecasts and real estate derivatives prices.</description><author>Bond, Shaun A.; Mitchell, Paul</author><pubDate>Sat, 01 Jan 2011 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Mortgage Flows and Commercial Property Price Cycles</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Clayton, Jim; Peng, Liang

Despite the fact that commercial real estate is composed of a large proportion of investable assets, a functioning derivatives market for private real estate has only existed since early 2005 when swap contracts began to be traded in the U.K. in significant amounts. Among other concerns about commercial real estate derivatives, the pricing issue is a major obstacle for the development of the market due to the specific characteristics of appraisal-based indices used as the underlying of these derivatives. In this article, Rehring and Steininger empirically evaluate a model of normative commercial real estate swap pricing, based on private real estate market indices, by estimating future appraisal-based index returns and accounting for time-varying equilibrium risk premia. The authors analyze the differences between the U.S. and the U.K. They interpret the development of actual commercial real estate swap prices in recent years in light of calculated "fair" swap prices. Qualitatively, the estimated swap prices track actual market developments quite well, indicating that the modeled swap prices enhance our understanding of the pricing of commercial real estate swaps.</description><author>Rehring, Christian; Steininger, Bertram I.</author><pubDate>Sat, 01 Jan 2011 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>European CMBS Pricing: Bond, Mortgage, and Real Estate Characteristics</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Marcato, Gianluca; Tira, Giovanni Alberto
The recent global economic crisis is often associated with the development and pricing of mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and underlying products (i.e., subprime mortgages). In their research, Marcato and Tira use a rich database of MBS issues and present the first attempt to price commercial MBS (CMBS) in the European market. Their results are consistent with research carried out in the U.S. market. They find that multinational as well as bond-, mortgage-, and real estate-related characteristics show different degrees of significance in explaining European CMBS spreads at issuance. Multiple linear regression analysis, using a databank of CMBSs issued between 1997 and 2007, indicates a strong relationship with bond-related factors, followed by real estate and mortgage market conditions. Marcato and Tira also find that multinational factors are significant, with country of issuance, collateral location, and access to more-liquid markets all being important in explaining the cost of secured funding for real estate companies. As floater-coupon tranches tend to be riskier and exhibit higher spreads, they also estimate a model using this subset of data. The results hold and hence reinforce their findings. Finally, the authors estimate their model for both tranches A and B and find that real estate factors become relatively more important for the riskier investment products.</description><author>Marcato, Gianluca; Tira, Giovanni Alberto</author><pubDate>Sat, 01 Jan 2011 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>The Changing Face of Real Estate Investment Management</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Clayton, Jim; Fabozzi, Frank J.; Giliberto, S.

The real estate investment management industry has been undergoing a process of change over the last two decades. The market is far more transparent than it once was due to the availability of far more, and more detailed, market information. Combined with the increasing integration of real estate with the broader capital markets, this has led to a market that reacts more quickly to events, exhibits more volatility, and in which the nature of risk has changed. These ongoing changes in the market, combined with the lessons of the financial crisis, have resulted in risk management becoming a topic of primary importance in real estate investment. Changes in the nature of real estate risk and the increased emphasis on risk management have the potential to create substantial changes in the real estate investment management industry going forward. The greatest challenge for the industry will be cultural-an understanding of risk, its sources, and its management will need to become central to investment decision making.</description><author>Clayton, Jim; Fabozzi, Frank J.; Giliberto, S.

Structured asset securitization is capable of generating a number of economic benefits including liquidity provision, an increased ability to manage risk, and value enhancement through the pooling and partitioning of cash flows. But the recent financial crisis has exposed numerous structural flaws, which has led many observers to question whether asset- and mortgage-backed securities should be classified as financial weapons of mass destruction" that require strict containment and possibly even elimination. In this article, Riddiough considers the fundamental economic trade-offs associated with securitization with an eye toward policy development, concluding that asset securitization can work. Whether it actually will work depends on how policymakers respond to the significant challenges of reregulating the financial system.</description><author>Riddiough, Timothy J.</author><pubDate>Sat, 01 Jan 2011 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Exploiting Property Characteristics in Commercial Real Estate Portfolio Allocation</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Plazzi, Alberto; Torous, Walter; Valkanov, Rossen

The richness of this extensive dataset and the flexibility of the parametric portfolio approach allow the authors to consider: 1) a large cross section of individual properties across various regions and property types, 2) several property-specific conditioning variables such as cap rates, appraisal values, and vacancy rates, and 3) various macroeconomic factors. Property-specific conditioning information is found to be economically important even for portfolios that are well diversified.</description><author>Plazzi, Alberto; Torous, Walter; Valkanov, Rossen</author><pubDate>Sat, 01 Jan 2011 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Are All Open-End Core Funds Created Equal?</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Fairchild, Simon; MacKinnon, Greg; Rodrigues, John
Open-end core real estate funds (OECFs) are an important component of the institutional property markets, but have received scant attention in the research literature. Fairchild, MacKinnon, and Rodrigues examine a sample of OECFs to determine if their underlying portfolios are consistent with common definitions of "core" and to what extent core funds provide beta exposure to the market. Generally, OECFs appear to hold core-type portfolios, but this is not universal. In particular, smaller funds tend to be less diversified and have higher idiosyncratic volatility. Many OECFs have a surprisingly large exposure to development projects. The authors find that leverage also plays a key role in an analysis of OECFs. While most OECF returns are driven by the broad market, OECFs are usually an aggressive play on the market, with each fund's aggressiveness determined by its leverage. Further, although the authors find evidence of persistence in OECF returns, a closer look reveals that this may be due to funds varying their capital structure over time. Overall, while most OECFs appear driven by similar factors, not all are created equal; investors should conduct careful due diligence on their OECF investments, with special attention to fund size and leverage.</description><author>Fairchild, Simon; MacKinnon, Greg; Rodrigues, John</author><pubDate>Sat, 01 Jan 2011 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>How Accurate Are Commercial Real Estate Appraisals? Evidence from 25 Years of NCREIF Sales Data</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Cannon, Susanne Ethridge; Cole, Rebel A.
In this study, Cannon and Cole provide new evidence on the performance measurement and reporting of commercial real estate returns. They do so by examining the accuracy of commercial real estate appraisals that occurred prior to the sale of properties from the NCREIF National Property Index (NPI) from 1984 to 2010, a period that spans two up-and-down market cycles. The authors find that, on average, appraisals are more than 12% above, or below, subsequent sales prices that take place two quarters following the appraisal. Even in a portfolio context, allowing for offsetting positive and negative differences, appraisals are off by an average 4%-5% of value, even after adjusting for capital appreciation during those two quarters. The authors also provide new evidence regarding how, and by how much, appraised values lag behind sales prices. They find that appraisals appear to lag the true sales prices, falling significantly below in hot markets and remaining significantly above in cold markets. This new evidence provides guidance to investors, regulators, and others about how to interpret real estate indices such as the NPI, which are based on appraised values, in both a rising and a falling market. Finally, the authors find that this "appraisal error" is largely systematic; they can explain more than half of the variation in the signed percentage difference in sales price and appraised value. Hence, appraisal errors are not due solely to property-specific heterogeneity.</description><author>Cannon, Susanne Ethridge; Cole, Rebel A.</author><pubDate>Sat, 01 Jan 2011 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Housing Risk and Return: Evidence from a Housing Asset-Pricing Model</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Case, Karl; Cotter, John; Gabriel, Stuart
Case, Cotter, and Gabriel investigate the risk-return relationship in the determination of housing asset pricing. In so doing, they evaluate the behavioral hypotheses advanced by Case and Shiller in studies of boom and post-boom housing markets. The authors specify a multifactor housing asset-pricing model and evaluate whether the market factor and other measures of risk, including idiosyncratic risk, momentum, and MSA size effects, have explanatory power for metropolitan-specific housing returns. Further, they test the robustness of the asset pricing results to inclusion of controls for socioeconomic variables commonly represented in the house price literature, including changes in employment, affordability, and foreclosure incidence, and find a sizable and statistically significant influence of the market factor on MSA house price returns. Moreover, they show that market betas have varied substantially over time. Results are largely robust to the inclusion of other explanatory variables, including standard measures of risk and other housing market fundamentals. Additional tests of model validity using the Fama-MacBeth framework offer further strong support of a positive risk-and-return relationship in housing. Case, Cotter, and Gabriel's findings are supportive of the application of a housing investment risk-return framework in explanation of the variation in the metro-area cross section and time series of U.S. house price returns. Further, results strongly corroborate the Case-Shiller survey research, which indicates the importance of speculative forces in the determination of U.S. housing returns.</description><author>Case, Karl; Cotter, John; Gabriel, Stuart</author><pubDate>Sat, 01 Jan 2011 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Property-Level Performance Attribution: Investment Management Diagnostics and the Investment Importance of Property Management</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Feng, Tony; Geltner, David
Feng and Geltner describe a field demonstration of a new technique for property-level performance attribution based on the since-acquisition internal rate of return of the investment. The internal rate of return is parsed among the components of initial yield, cash flow change, and yield change, each of which (along with the overall internal rate of return) is compared against a NCREIF-based custom benchmark for each property over the same investment horizon. Among these three, cash flow change particularly reflects the investor's property-level operational management over the holding period. The analysis is then applied across the Client Fund's entire property portfolio to derive diagnostic indications about the strengths and weaknesses of the Fund's investment management. The technique is applied to 42 institutional-quality property investments from acquisition through disposition spanning 1983-2008. In this case, the Client Fund is found to show strength (relative to NCREIF peers) in acquisition, but relative weakness in long-term post-acquisition operational management at the property level. The authors also find wide dispersion in outcomes at the property level, with a clear management pattern in the outlier, most successful cases of superior property-level operational management. Hence, improving property-level operational management emerges in the example portfolio as a key to better overall investment performance. Feng and Geltner speculate that this pattern may often be the case in large institutional funds due to their financial strength, which draws a first look at the best deals, but is offset by disadvantages in subsequent long-run operational management and disposition.</description><author>Feng, Tony; Geltner, David</author><pubDate>Sat, 01 Jan 2011 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Revisiting the Impact of Large Assets on Real Estate Portfolio Returns</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Esrig, Dave; Hudgins, Michael C.; Cerreta, Luigi
In this article, Esrig, Hudgins, and Cerreta investigate if large properties have outperformed the institutional property market over time. This topic is relevant for real estate investors and portfolio managers considering property size as a way to differentiate portfolio performance. The body of academic literature on large asset performance is inconclusive due to issues in applied methodologies and definitions. This study uses a new methodology that corrects for property type, stale appraisals, and restricts "large" to the relatively selective and well-defined group that would strike a knowledgeable institutional investor as truly large. The authors also look at performance of large assets across major and non-major markets. Key findings are that large assets, as most reasonably defined, have historically outperformed other properties in the NCREIF database on an absolute and a risk-adjusted basis. This finding applies to all three sectors the authors tested: office, multifamily, and retail. Property size remains an important factor after correcting for large asset overrepresentation in six major markets.</description><author>Esrig, Dave; Hudgins, Michael C.; Cerreta, Luigi</author><pubDate>Sat, 01 Jan 2011 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>130/30: By How Much Will the Information Ratio Improve?</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Tol, Ramon; Wanningen, Christiaan

Currency investors exhibit a tendency to cut risk by pairing both longs and shorts following losses and a weaker tendency to add risk following gains. By differentiating between position-level, portfolio-level, and aggregate cross-portfolio losses in currency investments, the authors demonstrate that this dynamic loss aversion spans multiple frames of reference. Losses are not compartmentalized, but rather a loss in one currency may impact trading in another. The authors also show that while the impact of a loss on subsequent trading decisions does linger, the effect declines sharply after a losing position is closed.</description><author>Froot, Kenneth; Arabadjis, John; Cates, Sonya; Lawrence, Stephen</author><pubDate>Sat, 01 Jan 2011 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Market Diversity and the Performance of Actively Managed Portfolios</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Agapova, Anna; Ferguson, Robert; Greene, Jason
Agapova, Ferguson, and Greene examine a theoretically motivated measure of the "size effect" known as market diversity and link it to the relative returns of institutional actively managed portfolios. Market diversity reflects how disperse or concentrated capital is across firms in the market, with changes in market diversity reflecting movement of capital between relatively large firms to relatively small firms. Changes in market diversity explain a statistically and economically significant amount of variation in the relative returns of actively managed institutional large-cap strategies. The authors estimate that an increase (decrease) in market diversity of 1% leads to an average increase (decrease) in relative returns of approximately 30 basis points, with higher tracking error strategies showing relatively more sensitivity. They find that another measure of the size effect, the Fama-French small-minus-big factor, explains less of the variation in actively managed large-cap strategies' relative returns and is rejected in favor of changes in market diversity as the underlying explanatory variable for actively managed strategies' relative returns. The authors suggest that market diversity provides academics and practitioners an important measure of market conditions when evaluating the performance of actively managed portfolios.</description><author>Agapova, Anna; Ferguson, Robert; Greene, Jason</author><pubDate>Sat, 01 Jan 2011 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Global Tactical Sector Allocation: A Quantitative Approach</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Doeswijk, Ronald; van Vliet, Pim
Doeswijk and van Vliet examine seven variables for global tactical sector allocation (GTSA) purposes. They construct 10 global sector indices over the extended sample period from 1970 to 2008, enabling them to test previously documented variables on a global basis and to examine whether they continued to work after their publication dates. Doeswijk and van Vliet document significant returns for the following strategies: momentum (1-month and 12-1 month), earnings revisions, and sell-in-May seasonal, also after their publication dates. By contrast, monetary policy and valuation (mean reversion and dividend yield) fail to predict global sector returns. The authors' out-of-sample tests reveal an average decay in performance of about one-third. A long short GTSA strategy that combines momentum with seasonal has an annual success ratio of 82% and delivers a compounded annual return of 9.9% after transaction costs. The authors believe that a global sector allocation study with such a long sample period and with such a broad range of variables has not been conducted before.</description><author>Doeswijk, Ronald; van Vliet, Pim</author><pubDate>Sat, 01 Jan 2011 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Breadth, Skill, and Time</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Grinold, Richard C.; Kahn, Ronald N.
The information ratio determines the potential of an investment process to add value, and according to the fundamental law of active management, adding value depends on a combination of skill and breadth. Grinold and Kahn use an equilibrium dynamic model to provide insight into the concept of breadth, as well as a refined notion of skill. In equilibrium, the arrival rate of new information exactly balances the decay rate of old information. Grinold and Kahn denote the information turnover rate g. It is relatively easy to measure for any investment process. If the investment process forecasts returns on N assets, the breadth of the strategy i is g . N. Skill-the correlation of forecasts and returns-increases with the return horizon for small horizons, but then asymptotically decays to zero for very long horizons. The authors' main result is that the ex ante information ratio is IR=kappa.root g.N, where kappa is a measure of skill.</description><author>Grinold, Richard C.; Kahn, Ronald N.</author><pubDate>Sat, 01 Jan 2011 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Remembering Barbara S.

Tactical asset allocators operate on the assumption that if risk premiums increase, higher-rated bonds will outperform lower-rated bonds, and that if risk premiums decrease, the reverse will happen. Empirical testing shows, however, that about 30% of the time, these expected relationships break down. Drawing on a classic debate among corporate bond market participants, investors might hypothesize that tactical asset allocators can improve their results by classifying bonds according to market-based risk premiums rather than by agency-generated ratings. In the context of tactical asset allocation, however, Fridson and Mcleod-Salmon do not find the market to be a shrewder judge of credit risk than the rating agencies. The solution to the problem of perverse outcomes in credit-oriented tactical asset allocation may be to combine top-down sector selection techniques with bottom-up security selection.</description><author>Fridson, Martin; Mcleod-Salmon, Camille</author><pubDate>Sat, 01 Jan 2011 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Simple and Robust Risk Budgeting with Expected Shortfall</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Philips, Thomas; Liu, Michael
Portfolio managers who exploit diversified sources of alpha have traditionally allocated risk among these alpha sources using Markowitz's mean-variance paradigm. While this paradigm works well when returns are normally distributed, it is far less effective when the strategies have significant tail risk, as is often the case in fixed income. In this article, the authors describe a new risk budgeting algorithm that allocates risk among fixed-income strategies in a way that takes into account both their tracking error and their tail risk, and which charts a pragmatic middle course between the elegant simplicity of mean-variance optimization and the computational complexity of most robust risk allocation algorithms. It is, to the best of the authors' knowledge, the first robust risk budgeting algorithm that can be solved in closed form on the back of an envelope. The algorithm inherits its closed-form solvability from a pragmatic compromise the authors make they keep one foot in the "old world" by beginning with using variance as the measure of risk, and then plant the other foot firmly in the "new world" by switching at an appropriate point to using expected shortfall as the measure of risk. It works well in practice in spite of its simplicity and yields fixed-income risk allocations that reflect both a portfolio manager's and a risk manager's intuition better than does a standard mean-variance risk budget.</description><author>Philips, Thomas; Liu, Michael</author><pubDate>Sat, 01 Jan 2011 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Stock Return Expectations and P/E10</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Benson, Earl D.; Bortner, Ben D.; Kong, Sophie
Benson, Bortner, and Kong estimate the return on equities using the matrix approach suggested by Bogle in 1991. In addition to Bogle's approach, the authors incorporate share repurchases as suggested by Grinold and Kroner in 2002 and by Shiller's P/E10. They demonstrate that this relatively simple approach provides reasonable estimates of subsequent 10-year returns for the S&amp;P 500 Index. The authors also focus on the relationship between the P/E10 ratio and the market's subsequent return. The authors demonstrate that when P/E10 is at low (high) levels in its historic range, the subsequent average 10-year market returns are relatively high (low or negative). When subsequent 3- and 5-year returns are examined, the relationship between P/E10 and subsequent average annual returns is even stronger. Finally, the authors' analysis suggests that the demonstrated approach may be used to estimate returns for various market sectors or indices by applying the approach to estimating the returns on three Russell indices.</description><author>Benson, Earl D.; Bortner, Ben D.; Kong, Sophie</author><pubDate>Sat, 01 Jan 2011 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>A Hybrid Approach to Combining CART and Logistic Regression for Stock Ranking</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Zhu, Min; Philpotts, David; Sparks, Ross; Stevenson, Maxwell J.
The performance of a stock relative to a suitable peer group is often influenced by a multitude of factors and their interactions. Traditional parametric models, albeit very useful, are often inadequate in capturing complicated relationships. In contrast, the nonparametric decision tree technique, such as classification and regression trees (CART), is more capable of capturing any nonlinearities and high-order interactions among stock characteristics, with the additional convenience of graphically representing the model, but discontinuous and coarse-grained responses produced by CART are potentially undesirable. In contrast, traditional regression models such as logistic regression produce a smooth response surface, which is more tractable in practice. The authors use a hybrid approach that takes advantage of the strengths in both parametric (logistic regression) and nonparametric models (CART). An application of this sophisticated technique to North American defensive stocks demonstrates its usefulness.</description><author>Zhu, Min; Philpotts, David; Sparks, Ross; Stevenson, Maxwell J.</author><pubDate>Sat, 01 Jan 2011 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Does Active Management Provide Investor Surplus?</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Jacobsen, Brian J.
A consumer experiences consumer surplus when she pays less than her reservation price for a product. Similarly, an investor experiences investor surplus when he would be willing to pay more than the charge to invest in a particular instrument or portfolio. Typically, a portfolio manager generates investor surplus by delivering alpha. Jacobsen formally shows in this article that a portfolio manager can also generate investor surplus by having asymmetric betas, that is, when the beta in up markets is different than the beta in down markets. Because no one forces investors to buy active management, they must perceive benefits that exceed the cost. Some of these benefits (custody, diversification, accounting, partial share ownership) are also available from passive strategies; others (expected differences in up and down market betas, alphas, optionality, cocktail party conversation) are only available from active management.</description><author>Jacobsen, Brian J.</author><pubDate>Sat, 01 Jan 2011 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Is There a Bubble in LinkedIn's Stock Price?</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Jarrow, Robert; Kchia, Younes; Protter, Philip

Two information revolutions are underway in trading and investing. Most headlines focus on structured quantitative market information at ever higher frequencies, but the other technology revolution in trading and investing is driven by qualitative, textual, and relationship information. The IBM computer Watson's overwhelming Jeopardy victory demonstrated how good machines can get at this. News analysis is a focus of language technology in finance. In this article, Leinweber and Sisk include event studies and show U.S. portfolio simulation results for "pure news" signals applied over the period 2006-2009 as well as a true out-of-sample period in 2010, which indicates alpha in excess of 10% a year. The authors also describe other applications of automated qualitative analysis for information-driven social media client relations.</description><author>Leinweber, David; Sisk, Jacob</author><pubDate>Sat, 01 Jan 2011 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>The Microstructure of the "Flash Crash": Flow Toxicity, Liquidity Crashes, and the Probability of Informed Trading</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Easley, David; de Prado, Marcos M.

Existing studies on market seasonality and the size effect are largely based on realized returns. In this article, Chen and Jindra investigate seasonal variations and size-related differences in a cross-stock valuation distribution. They use three stock valuation measures, two derived from structural models and one from the book-to-market ratio. The authors find that the average valuation level is highest in mid-summer and lowest in mid-December. Furthermore, the valuation dispersion (kurtosis) across stocks increases toward year-end and reverses direction after the turn of the year, suggesting increased movements in both the underand overvaluation directions. Among size groups, small-cap stocks exhibit the sharpest decline in valuation from June to December and the highest rise from December to January. For most months, small-cap stocks have the lowest valuation among all size groups and show the widest cross-stock valuation dispersion, meaning that they are also the hardest to value. Overall, large-cap stocks enjoy the highest valuation uniformity and are the least subject to valuation seasonality.</description><author>Chen, Zhiwu; Jindra, Jan</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jan 2010 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Finding Fair Value in Global Equities: Part II-Forecasting Returns</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Daly, Kevin; Nielsen, Anders Ersbak Bang; Oppenheimer, Peter
This article is the second of a two-part series that develops a framework for comparative valuation of major equity markets around the world. In this article, the authors invert the dividend discount model (DDM) discussed in "Fair Value in Global Equities: Part I," published in the preceding issue of this journal, in order to extract a time series of the implied equity risk premium (ERP) and the real required return (RRR). They estimate regression equations to find the macroeconomic drivers of these series. The ERP increases with the output gap at home and abroad, as well as with high past values of the ERP. This relationship allows for benchmarking the ERP and the RRR to the current economic environment and to forecasts of the future economic environment. The authors compare the use of these tools with other ways to forecast returns. At a five-year horizon, valuation alone is a good predictor of future returns, and the current value of the RRR works particularly well in this regard. At a one-year horizon, forecasts based on the benchmarking of the RRR to the future economic environment work significantly better than traditional valuation metrics, if the economic outlook is correct.</description><author>Daly, Kevin; Nielsen, Anders Ersbak Bang; Oppenheimer, Peter</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jan 2010 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Accentuated Intraday Stock Price Volatility: What Is the Cause?</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Ozenbas, Deniz; Pagano, Michael S.; Schwartz, Robert A.
In equity markets, the opening and closing of trading are particularly stressful periods. Ozenbas, Pagano, and Schwartz investigate the quality of price determination at these times (compared to midday periods) for large-, mid-, and smallcapitalization stocks on the NYSE, NASDAQ, and London Stock Exchange. Using three different metrics, they consistently find lower quality at both the open and the close. The deterioration of market quality at openings is greatest for large- cap stocks, but no systematic association with cap size is observed at the close. Large-cap stocks evidently lead smaller-cap stocks in finding new equilibrium values, and accentuated volatility at the open is in large part attributable to the complexities of price discovery.</description><author>Ozenbas, Deniz; Pagano, Michael S.; Schwartz, Robert A.</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jan 2010 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Risk Management Lessons Worth Remembering from the Credit Crisis of 2007-2009</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Golub, Bennett W.; Crum, Conan C.
This article by Golub and Crum presents six important lessons worth remembering from the credit crisis of 2007-2009. The recent credit crisis revealed the inadequacy of many standard methods in quantitative risk management and called into question the general efficiency of markets. Golub and Crum's analysis of the six lessons learned provides insights into what went wrong and offers advice on steps that institutions can take to avoid similar failures in the future. The authors present detailed analysis on risk management issues relating to liquidity, securitized products, certification, market risk, and policy risk.</description><author>Golub, Bennett W.; Crum, Conan C.</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jan 2010 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Crisis and Innovation</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Shiller, Robert J.
In this article, Shiller articulates the need for innovationenhancing regulation, not regulation that arbitrarily ties markets down. In the several years since the crisis began in 2007, only the first couple of stages of crisis response have been experienced. Other stages are expected. The next stage will be one in which the markets are made fundamentally more resilient and less prone to crisis. The final stage of response will be one in which the scope and depth of financial markets are expanded in order to move closer to completing the fundamental task of risk management, broadly construed. Together, all of these stages of response might take 10 years or longer.</description><author>Shiller, Robert J.</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jan 2010 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Survival of the Richest</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Lo, Andrew W.

Do stocks of admired companies yield admirable returns? Are increases in admiration followed by high stock returns, and how reliable is the relation between admiration and returns? These questions are answered by Anginer and Statman based on their study of Fortune magazine's annual list "America's Most Admired Companies." They find that from April 1983 through December 2007 stocks of admired companies had lower returns, on average, than stocks of spurned companies and that increases in admiration were followed, on average, by lower returns. The authors also find that the dispersion of returns is high, especially in the portfolio of spurned company stocks, implying that investors who would like to benefit from the return advantage of spurned company stocks must diversify widely among them.</description><author>Anginer, Deniz; Statman, Meir</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jan 2010 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Do Seasonal Anomalies Still Work?</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Dzhabarov, Constantine; Ziemba, William T.
Dzhabarov and Ziemba investigate whether traditional seasonal anomalies, such as the January effect, monthly effect, January barometer, sell-in-May-and-go-away phenomenon, holiday effect, and turn-of-the-month effect, still exist in the turbulent markets of the early part of the 21st century. The evidence indicates that there is still value in these anomalies. In their study, the authors use futures data from 1993 to 2009 and from 2004 to 2009 for small-cap stocks measured by the Russell 2000 Index and for large-cap stocks measured by the S&amp;P 500 Index. As was true in the 1990s, the effects tend to be stronger in small-cap stocks. The results are useful for investors who wish to tilt portfolios and for speculators who wish to trade the effects.</description><author>Dzhabarov, Constantine; Ziemba, William T.</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jan 2010 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Volatility Exposure for Strategic Asset Allocation</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Briere, Marie; Burgues, Alexandre; Signori, Ombretta
Briere, Burgues, and Signori examine the advantages of incorporating strategic exposure to equity volatility into the investment opportunity set of a long-term equity investor. They consider two standard volatility investments: implied volatility and volatility risk premium strategies. An analytical framework, which offers pragmatic solutions for longterm investors who seek exposure to volatility, is used to calibrate and assess the risk-return profiles of portfolios. The benefit of volatility exposure for a conventional portfolio is shown through a mean-modified Value at Risk portfolio optimization. A pure volatility investment makes it possible to partially hedge downside equity risk and thus reduce the risk profile of a portfolio, while an investment in the volatility risk premium substantially increases returns for a given level of risk. A well-calibrated combination of the two strategies enhances both the absolute and risk-adjusted returns of a portfolio.</description><author>Briere, Marie; Burgues, Alexandre; Signori, Ombretta</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jan 2010 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>A Bond-Picking Model for Corporate Bond Allocation</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>L'Hoir, Mathieu; Boulhabel, Mustafa
An active investment process in corporate bonds requires an approach that explicitly takes into account the diversification benefits that can be derived from a combination of alpha signals. The main challenge is to find indicators that fulfill at least two conditions. First, each individual alpha signal should achieve consistent performance on a univariate basis, and second, each should exhibit relatively low performance correlation because low correlation is a necessary condition for generating a diversification effect. L'Hoir and Boulhabel show that the combination of three types of signals-valuation signals, equity return signals, and earning momentum signals-fulfills the aforementioned conditions and delivers consistent and stable risk-adjusted returns. The authors present the results of their study for the U. K. corporate bond market.</description><author>L'Hoir, Mathieu; Boulhabel, Mustafa</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jan 2010 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Valuation-Indifferent Weighting for Bonds</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Arnott, Robert D.; Hsu, Jason C.; Li, Feifei; Shepherd, Shane D.
In historical testing, valuation-indifferent weighting applied to U. S. and global equities has produced statistically significant and economically large outperformance when compared with traditional capitalization-weighted benchmarks. In this article, the authors apply valuation-indifferent weighting to U. S. investment-grade corporate bonds, U. S. high-yield bonds, and hard-currency emerging market bonds. They find that fixed-income portfolios constructed using valuation-indifferent weighting outperform their corresponding cap-weighted benchmarks. The authors also find that the outperformance is higher for markets in which more inefficiencies and greater volatilities would be expected to occur. Both findings are consistent with the empirical evidence produced in the equity applications of valuation-indifferent weighting, as well as in the proposed noise-in-price theoretical rationale for the results.</description><author>Arnott, Robert D.; Hsu, Jason C.; Li, Feifei; Shepherd, Shane D.</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jan 2010 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>When Should Investors Consider an Alternative to Passive Investing?</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Ezra, Don; Warren, Geoffrey J.

For decades, the standard deviation of investment returns and beta have been the dominant risk metrics and guideposts for building portfolios of risky assets, but these risk measures have provided little help in explaining the cross-asset and cross-market volatility experienced over the last two years. The most recent spate of selling-contagion arose largely as a result of fund flows across asset classes. These flows were related to the urgent and large need to reduce risk and leverage by those investors who found themselves on the brink of financial ruin as a result of losses incurred. The author explores a common source of tail risk-specifically, episodes of extreme liquidity scarcity associated with horizon uncertainty-as well as the correlation across the cash flow demands of market participants and the short-run constraints on market-making capital. Liquidity risk is often high after a long period of abundant liquidity driven by low fundamental volatility, rising economic growth, and returns with trending patterns. Long option positions provide a natural hedge for liquidity risk, generating profits and losses based on the underlying security's price movement without any need to trade as well as from the likely increased volatility premium.</description><author>Hill, Joanne M.</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2009 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Clairvoyant Value II: The Growth/Value Cycle</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Arnott, Robert D.; Li, Feifei; Sherrerd, Katrina F.
The concept of Clairvoyant Value, introduced by the authors in the Spring 2009 issue of this journal, facilitates exploration of how the market prices future growth expectations across securities and over time. The authors find both concurrent and predictive links between the intertemporal change in the Valuation Dispersion-the relative valuation gap between growth and value stocks-and the observed growth-value "cycle" in the market. On average, the dispersion is twice as wide as subsequent financial results would justify; that is, the market historically has overpaid for growth. The authors also show that a wide dispersion in valuation multiples has tended to precede periods of exceptional performance by value stocks relative to growth stocks. The total wealth effect of investing in a Clairvoyant Value portfolio provides value for a company's future business prospects, but perhaps a bit less so than might be surmised.</description><author>Arnott, Robert D.; Li, Feifei; Sherrerd, Katrina F.</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2009 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Understanding Two Remarkable Findings about Stock Yields and Growth</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Thomas, Jacob; Zhang, Frank
Two regularities regarding stock prices and expected inflation have received less attention than they deserve. First, earnings and dividend yields move with long-term expected inflation and risk-free rates. Second, analysts' forecasts of nominal growth, not real growth, vary little with expected inflation. These patterns are remarkable because financial economists predict exactly the opposite. One explanation for these contrary findings is that stock prices are too high (low) when inflation is low (high), because investors confuse nominal and real growth rates. The authors assert that investors are unlikely to be so systematically naive about expected inflation and argue that the contrary evidence is, in fact, consistent with a rational market. The key insight offered by the authors is that reported earnings include inflationary holding gains, which causes higher earnings yields when inflation is high (the first regularity) and, in turn, explains why forecasts of nominal growth need not vary with inflation (the second regularity).</description><author>Thomas, Jacob; Zhang, Frank</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2009 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Explaining Earnings Per Share Growth</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Bierman, Harold; Hass, Jerome E.
The authors examine the fundamental factors that determine earnings growth, including the role of share repurchase, and offer a simple method of calculating the expected long-term growth rate of earnings per share. Many factors can affect the sequence of earnings, and the ability to formulate earnings growth models helps analysts isolate the direct factors that are likely to impact future earnings and earnings growth. If the forecast of the growth rate of earnings per share with share repurchase is 0.15 and without share repurchase is 0.10, the analyst knows that 0.05 of the 0.15 growth rate results from the share repurchase. The actual growth rate may, in fact, be different, in which case the analyst can recompute the actual growth rates with and without the share repurchase.</description><author>Bierman, Harold; Hass, Jerome E.</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2009 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Share Repurchases and Stock Valuation Models</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Stowe, John D.; McLeavey, Dennis W.; Pinto, Jerald E.
Share repurchases have grown rapidly in recent years and have exceeded total cash dividends since 1997. Some analysts argue that incorporating repurchases into a discounted cash flow framework leads to higher equity valuations and higher expected return estimates and, further, that traditional dividend discount models (DDMs) are obsolete. The authors disagree and demonstrate that the objection to the DDM is based on a logical error of not accurately accounting for the effect of share repurchases on investors' future cash flows. The authors compare a traditional DDM and a correctly specified discounted total cash flow model (TCFM) to show that the valuations and rates of return are the same with both a constant-growth-type model and a more general model. Importantly, a TCFM can be used instead of, or in addition to, a DDM, and the selection of model can be based on the quality of the information applicable to a particular situation.</description><author>Stowe, John D.; McLeavey, Dennis W.; Pinto, Jerald E.</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2009 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Taming Global Village Risk II: Understanding and Mitigating Bubbles</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Sullivan, Rodney N.
Asset bubbles and their subsequent bursts have been a part of capital markets since modern capital markets began to evolve some 300 years ago. Although each bubble environment has its own distinguishing characteristics, certain common elements persist over time as the key ingredients of market bubbles-financial innovation, the emotions and psychology of investors, and leverage. The author explores how these features present themselves in market bubbles and the ensuing market disruptions, and offers some suggestions for improving future risk management. Among the recommendations is a strong, yet flexible, oversight framework having the goal of identifying and containing areas of excessive economic risk.</description><author>Sullivan, Rodney N.</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2009 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>An Asset-Liability Version of the Capital Asset Pricing Model with a Multi-Period Two-Fund Theorem</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Waring, M. Barton; Whitney, Duane
Despite the simplicity of its strategic asset allocation policy prescription, the original Two-Fund Theorem has never been used by practitioners. The authors present a new capital asset pricing model (CAPM) that incorporates investors' deferred spending plans, or "economic liabilities"-the underlying purpose behind A investments-and thus reveal a new risk-free asset, the investor's liability-matching asset portfolio. In combination with a slightly redefined world market portfolio of risky assets, the authors' model forms a new two-fund theorem that is sensible, practical, and usable. The revised theorem provides an accessible and tractable form of an intertemporal CAPM, bridging the large gap between the simplistic single-period CAPM of Sharpe and others and the difficult, complex intertemporal models of Merton and others.</description><author>Waring, M.

Recent increases in inflation uncertainty have increased investor awareness of the need to hedge against unexpected changes in price levels. Given that the capacity of the inflation-linked securities market is not sufficient to meet the collective demand of institutional and private investors and that the OTC inflation derivatives market suffers from a perceived increase in counterparty risk, investors are now turning to other asset classes to seek inflation protection. Using a vector error correction model that explicitly distinguishes between short-term and long-term dynamics in the joint distribution of asset returns and inflation, the authors show that real estate and commodities have particularly attractive inflation-hedging properties over long horizons and that these properties justify the introduction of these asset classes into pension fund liability-hedging portfolios. These results suggest that novel forms of liability-driven investment solutions, including commodities and real estate in addition to inflation-linked securities, can be designed to decrease the cost of inflation insurance for long-horizon investors.</description><author>Amenc, Noel; Martellini, Uonel; Ziemann, Volker</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2009 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Risk-Profiling Defined Benefit Pension Schemes</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Dempster, Michael A. H.; Germano, Matteo; Medova, Elena A.; Murphy, James K.; Ryan, Dermot; Sandrini, Francesco
A dynamic stochastic optimization model of strategic assetliability management is useful in advising underfunded defined benefit pension schemes on best practice for returning to solvency and long-term stability. The authors present an overview of the dynamic stochastic programming techniques involved and briefly describe the nature of Pioneer Investment's proprietary CASM simulator from which the asset class returns and pension scheme liabilities are generated. The stochastic optimization model is described precisely in the article as well as its solution using linear programming. To illustrate the approach, the authors offer two examples of defined benefit schemes using simple, conservative, fund liability models. The optimal dynamic asset allocations of the two examples reflect the motivation of second generation liability-driven investment schemes. Although the final salary scheme models are simple, more complex models can be incorporated with little extra effort into the system described by the authors. Most actuarial assessments used in practice can be modeled for this purpose.</description><author>Dempster, Michael A.

An important question often faced by global portfolio managers is how to efficiently allocate a turnover budget across multiple markets that demonstrate different market characteristics and alpha model efficacies. Extending a dynamic model to a multi-market context, the author is able to provide several key insights for guiding practice. The author finds that in equilibrium more of the turnover budget should be allocated to markets in which 1) the alpha model produces higher information ratios, 2) new information arrives more rapidly, or 3) it is less expensive to trade. Optimal turnover, however, is rather insensitive to the aversion to risk in a given market. The author's findings are derived within a cross-sectional framework, but this does not preclude their application in a multi-period turnover allocation problem.</description><author>Yin, Hao</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2009 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Portfolio Risk Consequences of Fixed-Income Exposures</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Warren, Geoff
Interest rate and credit exposures can have quite different consequences for risk when viewed from a total portfolio perspective and from the perspective of a fixed-income portfolio in isolation. Within a fixed-income portfolio, interest rate exposure enhances volatility, whereas credit exposure can play a diversifying role. Conversely, at the total portfolio level, credit exposure tends to augment risk, While interest rate exposure may impact only modestly, or possibly even reduce, overall portfolio volatility. This dichotomy can give rise to agency problems when management of fixed-income portfolios is delegated. The author suggests various approaches for designing fixed-income mandates to better align them with investor objectives.</description><author>Warren, Geoff</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2009 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Return-Risk Ratios Under Taxation</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Leibowitz, Martin L.; Bova, Anthony
Intuition implies that taxes always detract from investment returns, which is, of course, true, but intuition tells us nothing about how an investor's return-risk balance might be altered by taxation. The authors address the issue by drawing upon a simple two-asset model composed of cash and a single equity asset, with the latter subject to an advantageous capital gains tax rate. It turns out that even though the taxed investor receives a lower net return, a differential tax structure can lead to return-risk ratios that are actually greater than their tax-free counterparts. Over short-term horizons, given standard assumptions, the taxed investor's return-risk advantages are not sufficient to provide high probabilities for achieving positive spreads over the risk-free rate. To capture such excess returns with an acceptable probability, investors-taxed or not-must move to significant equity positions, plan on five-year or longer horizons, or assume the presence of higher-than-standard equity return premiums.</description><author>Leibowitz, Martin L.; Bova, Anthony</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2009 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Where Have Thirty Years Gone?

The authors compare the price of a stock at a given point in time with its ex post realized value, which is defined by the discounted net present value of subsequent actual cash distributions. This measure is called the Clairvoyant Value, that is, the value that a clairvoyant investor with perfect foresight would have placed on the company. Using a stock's Clairvoyant Value, the authors tease out surprising results relating to the extent to which the market has correctly anticipated various future growth rates and to which investors have paid up for future growth expectations. These findings provide additional historical evidence on market efficiency and the value effect in the U. S. stock market. The authors conclude that although growth stocks (i.e., those trading at high multiples) do historically exhibit superior future growth-the market overpays for superior growth expectations with statistical significance.</description><author>Arnott, Robert D.; Li, Feifei; Sherrerd, Katrina F.</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2009 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Five Principles to Hold Onto (Even When Your Boss Says the Opposite)</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Siegel, Laurence B.; Waring, M.

Although finance practitioners almost universally learn in school that the Sharpe market model, which separates all returns into alpha and beta, is the starting point for a number of key investment insights, they often forget, or disregard, this knowledge once they are on the job. The five most important insights that a practitioner should hold dear, regardless of what the boss says, are 1) the importance of making alpha and beta decisions separately; 2) the zero-sum nature of active management; 3) the different criteria needed to make alpha and beta decisions; 4) the great value of alpha successfully delivered; and 5) the desirability of paying appropriate fees for each return component or, in other words, high fees for alpha, low fees for beta.</description><author>Siegel, Laurence B.; Waring, M.

After studying the impact of fund size and fund flows on the subsequent performance of funds of hedge funds, the authors find that funds with more assets tend to produce higher returns at lower levels of volatility, resulting in superior risk-adjusted performance. Across the majority of the size spectrum, a positive concave relationship exists between fund asset size and performance, while a negative correlation relationship exists between asset size and standard deviation. The smallest 25% of funds of funds underperformed the largest 75% of funds of funds by more than 2% annually from January 1995 to November 2006. This performance differential arises because a higher portion of the smallest funds deliver lower alpha, causing them to subsequently fail. Past good performers attract new inflows, but strong inflows adversely affect the subsequent performance of previously top-performing funds. In contrast, the top-performing and largest funds with below average asset flows perform significantly better than top funds with above average flows</description><author>Xiong, James; Idzorek, Thomas; Chen, Peng; Ibbotson, Roger</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2009 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Effect of Non-Normality Dynamics on the Expected Return of Options</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Figelman, Ilya
The author shows that, somewhat surprisingly, the real-world expected value of an at-the-money call option does not increase when stock index returns are assumed to follow a more realistic process that than of geometric Brownian motion. Thus, the fact that instantaneous stock returns are not normally distributed does not detract from the efficacy of covered call (CC) strategies (relative to the stock index), which employ at-the-money call options. The analysis presented in this article concentrates on the efficacy of stock index CC strategies.

A small group of distressed bonds rated double-B do provide statistically lower default rates and higher bear market returns than single-B or triple-C issues. The authors also find no comparable advantages for bonds issued by public companies over bonds issued by private companies, which challenges the prevailing investor preference for public companies.

The authors investigate properties of synthetic fixed-income portfolios created by "recombining" a synthetic beta exposure with several hedge fund-based alpha sources. The recombination strategy has a risk/return profile superior to that of traditional long-only managers. But in order to implement the synthetic strategy, investors must pick fund managers. Manager selection risk is substantially greater in synthetic fixed-income portfolios compared to long-only ones, and incorporating this ex ante manager selection risk reduces the appeal of synthetic fixed income. Adequate diversification of this risk requires investing in at least five different hedge funds, which may increase the strategy's costs and diminish its attractiveness.

Investors with small portfolios, or a limited number of securities in their portfolios, may benefit from a new portfolio optimization method. Placing a limit on the number of assets in a portfolio turns the ordinary mean-variance portfolio optimization problem into a challenging puzzle, especially for larger investment universes. In response, practitioners typically employ either enumerative methods, such as branch-and-bound based on quadratic programming relaxation, or heuristic methods. Both approaches have their respective disadvantages in that quadratic programming-based branch-and-bound may fail to solve large problems in reasonable time and heuristics may produce solutions of unknown quality. The new method presented by the authors can be used to solve smaller problems to optimality. For larger problems, the method produces good heuristic solutions along with a useful estimate of their quality; that is, the distance from the optimum. The computational results are promising.</description><author>Kopman, Leonid; Liu, Shucheng Scott; Shaw, Dong</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2009 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>\ Markowitz Versus the Talmudic Portfolio Diversification Strategies</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Duchin, Ran; Levy, Haim
Although expected utility theory and the classical mean-variance diversification theory of Markowitz assert that optimal diversification depends on the joint distribution of returns, investors tend to ignore these well-accepted theoretical approaches in favor of the naive investment strategy promulgated in the Babylonian Talmud called the 1/3 rule (or the 1/n rule for n assets), which assigns an equal weight to each security in the portfolio. In testing the efficiency of the 1/n rule, the authors find that it outperforms the mean-variance rule for individual small portfolios out of sample, but for large portfolios (i.e., institutional investors) the Markowitz strategy is superior. The advantage of the 1/n rule in the out-of-sample analysis is the absence of exposures to estimation errors.</description><author>Duchin, Ran; Levy, Haim</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2009 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>The Black-Litterman Model for Active Portfolio Management</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Da Silva, Alexandre S.; Lee, Wai; Pornrojnangkool, Bobby
Portfolio optimization presents a challenge to investors through the tendency of small differences in expected return inputs to create major swings in portfolio weightings, sometimes leading to extreme portfolio allocations. The authors believe that the Black-Litterman (BL) model can play a highly constructive role in alleviating this problem for investors, because the model combines active investment views and equilibrium views through a Bayesian approach. So that investors can fully exploit this important investment model, the authors discuss the development of the BL model within the mean-variance portfolio efficiency paradigm, examine the phenomenon of unintentional trades and additional risks related to the traditional implementation of BL in active portfolio management, and propose a potential remedy that leads to portable alpha implementation of active portfolios.</description><author>Da Silva, Alexandre S.; Lee, Wai; Pornrojnangkool, Bobby</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2009 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Investing in Global Equities: An Alternative Approach to Structuring Equity Portfolios</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Lin, Wenling; Hoffman, Phil; Duncan, Ann

Not all value strategies are created equal; that is, correlations among different value strategies and among similar value strategies across markets are, in general, low. Thus, to preserve market neutrality and reduce exposure to volatility, investors need to augment value strategies and adopt a multi-strategy approach. Some exposures, however, are common to value strategies and are not diversified away. Among these exposures are value premiums and volatility jumps. The authors present their findings of value-based strategies in several markets, including top-down country allocation in equities, bonds, and currencies, and bottom-up stock selection in the U. S., Japan, and Germany. The focus of the authors' research is on the correlations among these strategies and their exposures to select market factors.</description><author>Qian, Edward; Sorensen, Eric H.; Hua, Ronald</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2009 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>The Opportunity Set: Market Opportunities and the Effective Breadth of a Portfolio</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Grinold, Richard C.; Taylor, Mark P.
The opportunity set (OS) is an ex post measure of the maximum Sharpe ratio for a given universe of assets. As the authors show, the average value of the OS is approximately equal to the square root of portfolio breadth, or the number of assets in a portfolio. The authors thus suggest an interpretation of the OS to be the effective breadth of a portfolio. Effective breadth is higher when the volatility of asset returns is high because such an environment offers investors more opportunities for generating returns, which is tantamount to having greater portfolio breadth. When asset return volatility is lower, the opposite is true; that is, effective breadth is lower and investors are hard-pressed to generate excess returns at any risk level.</description><author>Grinold, Richard C.; Taylor, Mark P.</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2009 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Micro versus Macro in a Disorderly World</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Bernstein, Peter L.

In an effort to determine the number and economic power of individuals who have the ability to use institutional-quality real estate, the authors develop a methodology to estimate the size of the middle class and its economic productivity in developing countries. The authors' model employs a long-tailed Pareto distribution to estimate the dispersion of wealth and productivity in each country included in the study-Brazil, China, India, Mexico, Russia, and Turkey. The model uses readily available secondary data, namely, GDP per capita and the Gini coefficient, in conjunction with a user-defined global threshold income level to define middle class. The methodology is general enough to be applied to any developing country and any threshold definition.</description><author>Kapas, Manidipa; Liang, Youguo</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Sep 2009 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>The Real Estate Risk Premium: A Developed/Emerging Country Panel Data Analysis</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>D'Argensio, John-John; Laurin, Frederic
In this article, the authors present a study of the country risk premium in the office real estate market. The authors identify the determinants of office capitalization rates across a panel of 52 emerging and developed countries between 2000 and 2006. The capitalization rate should be proportional to the perception of a country's risk, as measured by the country's government bond yields. Based on this assumption, the authors estimate an intertemporal country-specific real estate risk premium. In consideration of endogeneity, the authors also estimate a model to explain the 10-year government bond yield, which produces additional information on country risk assessment. The authors find that government bond yields are the main determinant of the capitalization rate. Real estate variables also play a role, but to a lesser extent.</description><author>D'Argensio, John-John; Laurin, Frederic</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Sep 2009 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Style Analysis in Real Estate Markets: Beyond the Sector and Region Dichotomy</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Fuerst, Franz; Marcato, Gianluca
Although returns-based style analysis has been studied extensively in equity markets, applications of this valuable tool for measuring and benchmarking performance and risk in a real estate context are still relatively new. Previous studies in the real estate market have identified three investment categories: sectors, administrative regions, and economic regions. The low explanatory power of this type of categorization, however, reveals the need to extend returns-based analysis within a real estate context. First, the authors review the obstacles to transferring equity style analysis to real estate. Then, they apply a multivariate model to randomly generated portfolios to test the significance of four real estate investment styles in explaining portfolio returns for various types of properties-small versus big, high yield versus low yield, concentrated versus diversified, and short lease versus long lease. Results show that alpha performance is significantly reduced when the new investment styles are accounted for; the small versus big property style is dominant. In addition, the authors find that the probability of obtaining alpha performance is dependent upon the actual exposure of funds to style factors and that both alpha and systematic risk levels are linked to the actual characteristics of portfolios. Overall, the authors' results suggest that fund managers should use one of the four (and possibly other) style factors to set benchmarks and to analyze portfolio returns.</description><author>Fuerst, Franz; Marcato, Gianluca</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Sep 2009 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Hedging Real Estate Risk</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Fabozzi, Frank J.; Shiller, Robert J.; Tunaru, Radu S.
A number of real estate derivatives are available worldwide. The authors discuss the issues related to the pricing of these instruments and to the managing of hedging instruments over time. The property derivatives are classified by the type of real estate risk they hedge: 1) housing price risk, 2) commercial property price risk, and 3) mortgage loan portfolio amortizing risk. Given the special characteristics of the real estate asset class-an incomplete market, difficult to hedge, and reversion to a long-term trend-the authors emphasize the main points that should be taken into account when pricing property derivatives.</description><author>Fabozzi, Frank J.; Shiller, Robert J.; Tunaru, Radu S.</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Sep 2009 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>REIT-Based Property Return Indices: A New Way to Track and Trade Commercial Real Estate</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Horrigan, Holly; Case, Brad; Geltner, David; Pollakowski, Henry
Using REIT return data, bond data, and property holding data, the authors construct property market segment-specific indices of asset returns. The authors show that these pure-play indices can be employed to make pure, targeted investments in the commercial real estate market while retaining the liquidity, transparency, and pricing efficiency benefits of the well-developed public market in REITs. These pure-play indices compare favorably with existing property market return indices, displaying volatilities similar to transaction-based indices, such as the Moody's/REAL Commercial Property Price Index, but tending to lead the private market in time. The pure-play indices can be generated at a daily frequency without significant noise and at various levels of market segment granularity and, notably, have led the transactions-based direct property market indices during the recent market downturn. The authors' findings suggest that the REIT-based pure-play indices may provide a unique, new information source about the commercial property market, as well as a unique capability to facilitate targeted investments, construct hedges, and potentially support derivatives trading.</description><author>Horrigan, Holly; Case, Brad; Geltner, David; Pollakowski, Henry</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Sep 2009 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Commercial Mortgage Default and Refinancing Risk: A Primer</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Corcoran, Patrick J.
In the period 1993-2006, commercial mortgages and commercial mortgage-backed securities provided highly competitive returns, on a risk-adjusted basis, relative to other investments in the stock and bond universe. The severe 2007-2009 financial market meltdown, induced by the downturn in the housing bubble, provides a stiff challenge to the continuation of previously strong results. Corcoran examines historical performance of commercial mortgage defaults and seeks to draw inferences about defaults in the unusual 2007-2009 U.S. economic downturn. The article serves as a primer for investors considering relative value in the sector at a bottom-of-the-cycle moment, when relative value is typically high.</description><author>Corcoran, Patrick J.</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Sep 2009 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>The Secular and Cyclic Determinants of Capitalization Rates: The Role of Property Fundamentals, Macroeconomic Factors, and "Structural Changes"</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Chervachidze, Serguei; Costello, James; Wheaton, William
In this article, the authors revisit many studies that have attempted to explain the determinants of real estate capitalization rates. Two new innovations are introduced. First, the authors identify two macroeconomic factors, in addition to risk-free Treasury rates, that greatly impact cap rates-the general corporate risk premium operating in the economy and the amount of debt (liquidity) available. The addition of these factors greatly adds to the ability of previous models to explain the secular fall of cap rates in the last decade and their recent rise. Second, the authors search for "structural" shifts in the cap rate using innovative tests, including a large number of macroeconomic factors. The tests identify two distinct periods that the authors label as "investor sentiment." A period of negative sentiment was identified from 1991 to 1996 and a period of positive sentiment was identified from 2002 to 2007. Methodologically, the analysis uses a large and robust quarterly panel dataset of 30 U.S. metropolitan areas from 1980 Q1 through 2007 Q4. The authors compare the models using traditional measures of within-sample fit, as well as how the models behave in in-sample backtest forecasts.</description><author>Chervachidze, Serguei; Costello, James; Wheaton, William</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Sep 2009 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Capital Markets Impact on Commercial Real Estate Cap Rates: A Practitioner's View</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Peyton, Martha S.
The capital markets turmoil that exploded credit spreads in mid-2007 had no discernible impact on commercial real estate pricing until a year later when capitalization rates associated with NCREIF-NPI property sales began to widen from all time lows. The model developed in this article identifies "signal variables" that could have been used to inform commercial real estate investor expectations in the interim. The model's results demonstrate that over short periods of time, cap rates can be predicted by macroeconomic and financial market conditions combined with commercial real estate market fundamentals. The effectiveness of these variables validates the integration of commercial real estate into the larger capital markets.</description><author>Peyton, Martha S.</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Sep 2009 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Understanding Commercial Real Estate: How Different from Housing Is It?</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Gyourko, Joseph
On the one hand, urban economics suggests that commercial real estate and owner-occupied housing are driven by common fundamentals, which should make them perform similarly. On the other hand, stronger limits to arbitrage in housing suggest that wider swings in prices, which are unrelated to fundamentals, are feasible in that property sector. And wider swings in fundamentals could be expected in the commercial sector due to the longer lead times for commercial buildings to be permitted and delivered, leading to a greater possibility of a temporal mismatch between supply and demand. Yet, the author finds many more similarities than differences across the two real estate sectors. The simple correlation between appreciation rates on owner-occupied housing and commercial real estate is between 40% and 60%, depending on the data source. Both sectors also exhibit similar time-series patterns in their price appreciation, with persistence across individual years and mean reversion over longer periods. In this article, Gyourko explores the various linkages between these two huge sectors, including the cost of land and materials, cost of capital, lender optimism, and access to the productivity and amenities of a given labor market area. With the recent dramatic declines in house prices, the strong similarities between the two sectors are foreboding given that the commercial real estate capital structure looks weak and a strong mean-reversion process in prices may still be underway.</description><author>Gyourko, Joseph</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Sep 2009 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Real Estate's Evolution as an Asset Class</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Clayton, Jim; Giliberto, S.

In this introductory article, the editors of this issue examine the impact of the credit crisis on commercial and multifamily real estate and provide a post-crisis, evolutionary view of real estate as an asset class. This is done by putting the events of the last 18 months into a broad perspective and within a framework that encompasses these major themes: 1) capital market integration, financial leverage, and sentiment; 2) the "failure" of diversification; 3) innovations in real estate portfolio risk measurement and management; and 4) international real estate. The aim of the article is to help investors understand the evolving characteristics of the asset class and to help them improve the effectiveness of actions that anticipate, monitor, and manage risk. It also sets the stage for the collection of articles in this issue that offer new insights into how commercial and multifamily real estate investing lines up with assumptions about market efficiency, outlier risks, theories of diversification, and longer-term asset and risk allocation.</description><author>Clayton, Jim; Giliberto, S.

I write at a time of financial and economic crisis in our nation and around the globe. I venture to assert that when the history of the financial era which has just drawn to a close comes to be written, most of its mistakes and its major faults will be ascribed to the failure to observe the fiduciary principle, the precept as old as holy writ, that 'a man cannot serve two masters.' No thinking man can believe that an economy built upon a business foundation can permanently endure without some loyalty to that principle. The separation of ownership from management, the development of the corporate structure so as to vest in small groups control over the resources of great numbers of small and uninformed investors, make imperative a fresh and active devotion to that principle if the modern world of business is to perform its proper function. Yet those who serve nominally as trustees, but relieved, by clever legal devices, from the obligation to protect those whose interests they purport to represent, corporate officers and directors who award to themselves huge bonuses from corporate funds without the assent or even the knowledge of their stockholders. financial institutions which, in the infinite variety of their operations, consider only last, if at all, the interests of those who funds they command, suggest how far we have ignored the necessary implications of that principle. The loss and suffering inflicted on individuals, the harm done to a social order founded upon business and dependent upon its integrity, are incalculable.</description><author>Bogle, John C.</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2009 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Risk is a Choice Rather Than a Fate</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Perold, Andre F.

Three prominent academic studies, all recently published, found that corporate bond investors have benefited from the post-trade transparency that has resulted from the reporting requirements mandated by the U. S. Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) Trade Reporting and Compliance Engine, or TRACE. The author argues that all three studies suffer from similar methodological shortcomings, such as confusing dealer mark-ups with commissions in measuring transactions costs and overlooking the far more relevant trading opportunity costs. And although TRACE may have facilitated price discovery, the author asserts that it is at the expense of quantity discovery and, thus, has incrementally decreased market liquidity. The SEC's implementation of TRACE was undoubtedly well intentioned, but it appears more harm than good was done to the investors it was meant to benefit.</description><author>Tempelman, Jerry H.</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2009 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Is There a Green Factor?</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Chia, Chin-Ping; Goldberg, Lisa R.; Owyong, David T.; Shepard, Peter; Stoyanov, Tsvetan
Climate change has far-reaching implications for the global economy and is increasingly being recognized by investors as a long-term investment theme. As more investors take note of companies that are well positioned to handle climate change, a common factor may account, in part, for the share prices of these companies. The authors search for the existence of this common factor, which they call the green equity factor. During the three-year period from May 2005 through May 2008, the authors find that a sample portfolio of renewable energy stocks outperformed the broad, global MSCI All Country World Index (ACWI), as well as a subindex consisting of traditional energy stocks. Their findings persist after adjusting for size, value, and country biases in the sample portfolio. Furthermore, a systematic analysis based on the Barra Global Equity Model supports the existence of a renewable energy risk factor.</description><author>Chia, Chin-Ping; Goldberg, Lisa R.; Owyong, David T.; Shepard, Peter; Stoyanov, Tsvetan</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2009 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Beyond the Central Tendency: Quantile Regression as a Tool in Quantitative Investing</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Gowlland, Chris; Xiao, Zhijie; Zeng, Qi
Quantitative investors frequently analyze factor performance using regression based on the familiar ordinary least squares approach. This is highly effective for understanding the central tendency within a dataset, but will often be less useful for assessing the behavior of datapoints close to the upper or lower extremes within a population. But from the perspective of active investors or risk managers, the datapoints at the extremes may be precisely the ones of greatest interest. For such applications, a more appropriate methodology is quantile regression. The authors show how quantile regression represents an extension of the conventional ordinary least squares method, and present an empirical analysis of factor effectiveness applied to a universe of U. S. small-cap stocks in order to illustrate the insights offered by this technique.</description><author>Gowlland, Chris; Xiao, Zhijie; Zeng, Qi</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2009 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Understanding the VIX</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Whaley, Robert E.

The authors examine the portfolio optimization problem that arises when a manager's mandate is a fund of funds with an asset allocation benchmark. The portfolio manager's objective is to maximize the portfolio excess return over the benchmark subject to given tracking errors. The authors decompose total tracking error into two components-the deviation from the benchmark and the additional risk factors associated with fund alpha. By quantifying the contribution of each component of portfolio excess return, the authors show that the performance of the style-constrained portfolio is determined by the active alpha-seeking skill of the portfolio manager and that fund alphas can be separated from their style loadings and are portable. These findings will not only help investors determine optimal tracking error constraints, but will also provide a framework for portfolio managers to identify funds with certain characteristics in order to achieve an optimal portfolio return.</description><author>Chen, Peng; Jiang, George J.; Zhu, Kevin X.</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2009 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Momentum Trading and Performance with Wrong Return Expectations</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Gatev, Evan; Ross, Stephen A.
Many long-term institutional investors use strategic portfolio allocation to maximize net asset value assuming that long-run expected returns are constant. This approach is complemented by tactical asset allocation when an asset class is perceived to offer higher expected returns in the short run. When investment performance is evaluated in the interim, it can be difficult to assess the merit of private beliefs about changing expected returns. The authors examine the annual expected return and dynamic trading under wrong assumptions about time-varying expected returns and show that a misspecified portfolio policy can outperform the correct policy. They also find that the particular assumptions about how expected returns vary through time can be identified from observed rebalancing of a portfolio. The assumption that expected returns are changing implies that momentum trading is optimal under certain conditions. In contrast, contrarian trading is always optimal when prices are assumed to follow a random walk around a constant long-term trend. These results can inform the annual performance evaluation of institutions, such as endowments, pension plans, mutual funds, and hedge funds that have long-term investment objectives.</description><author>Gatev, Evan; Ross, Stephen A.</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2009 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Portfolio Size Effect in Retirement Accounts: What Does It Imply for Lifecycle Asset Allocation Funds?</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Basu, Anup K.; Drew, Michael E.
Lifecycle funds offered by retirement plan providers allocate aggressively to risky asset classes when the employee participants are young, gradually switching to more conservative asset classes as they grow older and approach retirement. This approach focuses on maximizing growth of the accumulation fund in the initial years and preserving its value in the later years. The authors simulate terminal wealth outcomes based on conventional lifecycle asset allocation rules as well as on contrarian strategies that reverse the direction of asset switching. The evidence suggests that the growth in portfolio size over time significantly impacts the asset allocation decision. Due to the portfolio size effect that is observed by the authors, the terminal value of accumulation in retirement accounts is influenced more by the asset allocation strategy adopted in later years relative to that adopted in early years. By mechanistically switching to conservative assets in the later years of a plan, lifecycle strategies sacrifice significant growth opportunity and prove counterproductive to the participant's wealth accumulation objective. The authors' conclude that this sacrifice does not seem to be compensated adequately in terms of reducing the risk of potentially adverse outcomes.</description><author>Basu, Anup K.; Drew, Michael E.</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2009 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>On the Performance of Extended Alpha (130/30) versus Long-Only</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Tol, Ramon; Wanningen, Christiaan
Many have advanced the theoretical attractiveness of long-only extension products, more widely known as 130/30 strategies. In this article, the authors address the practical aspects of successfully implementing a 130/30 strategy based on an analysis of their unique database of actual manager performance for 130/30 versus long-only. The authors compare the returns of extension products with their long-only counterparts using a dataset of 73 product pairs from 53 managers, and find that 55% of the extension products have a higher information ratio than the corresponding long-only product. After testing for differences in the mean monthly alphas, the authors find that managers who deliver a higher information ratio in the 130/30 product also deliver mean monthly alphas in excess of the long-only product at a 5% significance level. Furthermore, the authors' analysis reveals that only 33% of the entire sample of managers adds value through shorting and only a small subset of managers is able to compensate for underperformance in short positions by outperforming in long positions while achieving a higher information ratio than the long-only counterpart product. The authors thus conclude that adding value in short positions is highly important in running a successful 130/30 strategy.</description><author>Tol, Ramon; Wanningen, Christiaan</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2009 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Long-Only: The Natural Benchmark Choice for 130/30</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Waid, Robert J.
Controversy surrounds the choice of a proper benchmark for short-extension investment strategies, such as a 130/30 strategy. Because these strategies are compared to hedge funds and have significant implementation differences compared to long-only strategies, peer groups or even a 130/30 index have been suggested as the appropriate benchmark. The author argues that a short-extension investment strategy is not a separate asset class and it competes for the same investment assets as a long-only strategy; thus, a short-extension investment strategy requires a long-only benchmark-rather than a unique benchmark-to measure manager skill.</description><author>Waid, Robert J.</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2009 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Diversification Performance and Stress-Betas</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Leibowitz, Martin L.; Bova, Anthony
In earlier research, the authors found that, on both a theoretical and historical basis, the typical diversified fund exhibits volatility characteristics that are strikingly similar to a traditional 60/40 allocation and, in severe market declines, should theoretically underperform the 60/40 portfolio. This latter and surprising result is due to the stress-beta effect that derives from diversification because the multiple asset classes are more vulnerable to correlation tightening than the two-asset 60/40 allocation. The year 2008 provided an (unwelcome) opportunity for the authors to test this stress effect. They found that in 2008 the diversified portfolio's correlation-based beta was, in fact, much higher than in normal times and that 2008 was the first period in which the diversified portfolio performed materially worse than the 60/40 portfolio. Thus, the typical model of institutional diversification should be viewed not as reducing risk in the short-term, but rather as a source of longer-term benefits in the form of greater return accumulation and wider divergence of outcomes.</description><author>Leibowitz, Martin L.; Bova, Anthony</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2009 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>More Social Security, Not Less</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Goetzmann, William N.
The feasibility of a government-sponsored insurance company that would be patterned after the government-sponsored mortgage agencies, and that would be authorized to sell government-insured wage-indexed retirement annuities, is explored. This enterprise would assume the current obligations and cash flows of the U. S. Social Security system in exchange for the exclusive right to sell additional insurance contracts, and may or may not choose to finance itself through the issuance of equity shares.

High allocations to alternative investments by investors, such as foundations and endowments, raise infrequently discussed concerns about liquidity. As the percentage of assets under management invested in alternatives rises, the availability of liquid equities and bonds available to meet spending requirements, capital calls, and margin calls plummets. A series of simulations shows how severe this problem can become in bear markets. The remedy for this problem is to ladder gradually into illiquid assets, so that expected future cash flows from these assets partially or fully offset capital calls and other cash requirements. New and enthusiastic investors in illiquid alternative investments sometimes forget this principle. By adhering to it, an alternatives program can be successful, but not on an unlimited scale. It is also necessary to hold a considerable portion of a portfolio in liquid stocks and bonds.</description><author>Siegel, Laurence B.</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2008 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Going Negative: What to Do with Negative Book Equity Stocks</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Brown, Stephen; Lajbcygier, Paul; Li, Bob
A firm's book equity is a measure of the value held by a firm's ordinary shareholders. Increasingly, it is being reported as a negative number. Because a firm's limited liability structure means that shareholders cannot have negative value, negative book equity has no obvious interpretation. Consequently, both practitioners and academics typically omit such stocks in their analysis. While these stocks are small in number, they are disproportionately represented in extreme growth? value sectors and, therefore, can have an impact on applications where value is defined in terms of book equity. The authors propose a new approach that classifies negative book equity stocks across the growth? value spectrum by considering how close their returns correspond to those of stocks that fit more obviously into these classifications. They find that this new value factor, which includes negative book equity stock, is economically and statistically different from the old value factor that excludes such stocks. Although they illustrate how this approach can be used to classify negative book equity stock, the approach is quite general and may be used whenever particular accounting data are unavailable or otherwise suspect.</description><author>Brown, Stephen; Lajbcygier, Paul; Li, Bob</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2008 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Sin Stock Returns</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Fabozzi, Frank J.; Ma, K.

Based on a small subset of the stock universe that has been generally associated with sin-seeking activities, such as alcohol consumption, adult services, gaming, tobacco, weapons, and biotech alterations, the authors find that a sin portfolio produced an annual return of 19% over the study period, unambiguously outperforming common benchmarks in terms of both magnitude and frequency. Several likely reasons for the positive excess returns in sin stocks are identified. The authors argue that trustees or fiduciaries who develop institutional investment policy statements should fully understand the economic consequences of screening out stocks of companies that produce a product inconsistent with their value systems. In addition, institutional investors should question if the cost to uphold common social standards is worthwhile.</description><author>Fabozzi, Frank J.; Ma, K.

Along with the ongoing effort to build market cap? independent portfolios, the authors explore the properties of diversification as a driver of portfolio construction. They introduce a measure of the diversification of a portfolio that they term the diversification ratio. The measure is then employed to build a risk-efficient portfolio, or the Most-Diversified Portfolio. The theoretical properties of the resulting portfolios are discussed and compared to other popular methodologies, such as market-cap weights, equal weights, and minimum variance. The empirical results confirm that these popular methodologies are dominated by risk-efficient portfolios in many aspects. The implication is that in the long run, actively managed portfolios that maximize diversification are strong candidates for achieving consistently better results than commonly used passive index tracking methodologies. The message is clear? investors and their trustees cannot afford to ignore the benefits of maximal diversification.</description><author>Choueifaty, Yves; Coignard, Yves</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2008 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Global Tactical Cross-Asset Allocation: Applying Value and Momentum Across Asset Classes</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Blitz, David C.; Van Vliet, Pim
Global tactical asset allocation (GTAA) strategies across a broad range of asset classes are explored in this article. In contrast to market timing for single asset classes and tactical allocation across similar assets, this topic has received little attention in the existing literature. The main finding documented in this article is that momentum and value strategies applied to GTAA across 12 asset classes deliver statistically and economically significant abnormal returns. For a long top-quartile and short bottom-quartile portfolio based on a combination of momentum and value signals, the authors report a return of 12% per annum over the 1986? 2007 period. Performance is stable over time, is also present in an out-of-sample period, and is sufficiently high to overcome transaction costs in practice. The return cannot be explained by potential structural biases toward asset classes with high risk premiums, nor by the Fama? French and Carhart hedge factors. The authors argue that financial markets may be macroinefficient due to insufficient "smart money" being available to arbitrage away mispricing effects.</description><author>Blitz, David C.; Van Vliet, Pim</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2008 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>On the Fundamental Law of Active Portfolio Management: How to Make Conditional Investments Unconditionally Optimal</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Zhou, Guofu
The fundamental law of active portfolio management tells an active manager how to transform his alpha forecasts into the valued-added of his active portfolio by using a linear strategy with active positions proportional to the forecasts. This linear strategy is conditionally optimal because it is optimal each period, conditional on the forecasts at that time. The unconditional value-added? the valued-added over the long haul or over multiple periods? is what the manager normally strives to achieve. Under this unconditional objective, the linear strategy can approach zero value-added if the forecasts or signals have a high kurtosis. To overcome this problem, the author provides an investment strategy that maximizes the unconditional value-added with the optimal use of conditional information. The strategy is nonlinear in the forecasts, but has a simple economic interpretation. When the alpha forecasts are high, an active manager invests less aggressively than the linear strategy, and when the forecasts are low, an active manager invests more aggressively. In this way, an active manager tends to smooth out value-added over time and, hence, on a risk-adjusted basis, the active manager's long-term unconditional value-added will be substantially higher than the value-added based on a linear strategy, particularly when the alpha forecasts experience high kurtosis.</description><author>Zhou, Guofu</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2008 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>What Caused the Mess?</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Bernstein, Peter L.

Mutual fund managers are evaluated primarily on their ability to outperform their peers (rather than outperform a stated index), although managers have no ex ante information on investment decisions made by their competitors. A new approach for constructing benchmarks of peer managers uses return-based style analysis, deriving a peer group's exposures to a predetermined set of market factors from past performance using an optimization algorithm. The objective of the optimization is to find weights for factors that result in the best possible replication of the mutual fund returns. Understanding the aggregate exposures of a manager's peers (and the dispersion among them) allows managers to better assess the trade-off between the risk taken relative to their peers and the benefit expected (outperformance). The approach offers the advantages of more timely comparisons, the capacity to observe intraperiod shifts, and the ability to construct historical time series more readily than enabled by data on the actual holdings of mutual funds.</description><author>Ben Dor, Arik; Budinger, Vernon; Dynkin, Lev; Leech, Kenneth</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2008 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>The beta continuum: From classic beta to bulk beta</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Anson, Mark
In the terminology of portfolio management, alpha versus beta has become a common expression even though many investors view alpha and beta as two disparate points on an economic compass. The reality is that there are a continuum of returns from pure beta on the one hand to pure alpha at the other end of the scale. Along the way there are multiple investment products in stages on the beta versus alpha Scale. The beta continuum can represent the many ways that systematic risk premiums are packaged and delivered to investors. Examples demonstrate that beta is not a single data point but an ever-increasing effort to capture systematic risk premiums in new and innovative ways that, at the end of the continuum, begin to resemble active management.</description><author>Anson, Mark</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2008 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>The short side of 130/30 investing for the conservative portfolio manager</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Gastineau, Gary L.
Many long-only investment managers are looking for ways to offer 130/30 strategies and other "enhanced long strategies" or "constrained long-short portfolios." Conservative portfolio managers with little or no experience in short-selling can use sector evaluations from their firms' investment process to add alpha with short positions in exchange-traded funds (ETFs). While individual stock selection has the greatest potential to add value on the short side as well as on the long, differences in performance among various domestic sectors come in a close second. The dispersion in sector performance combined with some advantages of using ETFs to implement short sector positions makes sector ETFs to establish the short side of a 130/30 position a compelling choice for investment managers without fully integrated long-short stock port folios. Some sector ETFs are easy to trade, easy to borrow, and easy to integrate as the short side of a long-short portfolio.</description><author>Gastineau, Gary L.</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2008 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>130/300: The new long-only</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Lo, Andrew W.; Patel, Pankaj N.
Long-only portfolio managers and investors have acknowledged that the long-only constraint is a potentially costly drag on performance, and loosening this constraint can add value, but the extent of the performance drag is difficult to measure without a proper benchmark for a 130/30 portfolio. A passive but dynamic benchmark can be developed, consisting of a plain-vanilla 130/30 strategy using simple factors to rank stocks and standard methods for construction of portfolios based on these rankings. Two types of indexes are produced-investable and look-ahead indexes; the former uses only prior information, and the latter uses realized returns to set an upper bound on performance. Historical simulations of these 130/30 benchmarks illustrate their advantages and disadvantages under various market conditions.</description><author>Lo, Andrew W.; Patel, Pankaj N.</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2008 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Enhanced active equity portfolios are trim equitized long-short portfolios (vol 34, pg 22, 2007)</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Jacobs, Bruce I.; Levy, Kenneth N.

The asset allocation decision is arguably the most important decision in the investment process. It involves allocating an investor's portfolio among a set of desirable asset classes, but the investor must first define the asset classes to consider. The concept of investment-consumption value may help investors decide on including non-traditional asset classes such as hedge funds or commodities. The decision framework is grounded in the financial economics of the consumption CAPM and state/preference models. From this perspective, commodities are one example to consider as an investable asset class.</description><author>Sullivan, Rodney N.</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2008 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>CAPM investors do not get paid for bearing risk: A linear relation does not imply payment for risk</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Markowitz, Harry M.

In fact, this is not a correct interpretation, because two securities may have different excess returns even though they have identical risk structures in terms of their covariances with other securities in the market.

While the simple investment principles espoused 60 years ago by Benjamin Graham remain valid today, investment strategies have become far more active, as the financial sector has come to play a dominant role in our economy. Mutual funds have become less diversified; their portfolio turnover has risen sixfold; and investors now hold fund shares for dramatically shorter periods. Fund expense ratios have risen sharply, a manifestation of the soaring costs of the US. financial sector, estimated at $528 billion in 2007. Financial sector earnings have risen commensurately, to more than $200 billion, contributing as much as one-third of the aggregate profits of the S&amp;P 500. As gross return in the financial markets, minus the costs of intermediation, must equal the net return delivered to investors, such costs constitute a substantial drag on investor wealth. Yet both the profession and the academic community have largely ignored systemwide costs. It is high time for an in-depth study of the costs and benefits of our financial system, to ensure that it functions in the national public interest and in the interest of investors.</description><author>Bogle, John C.</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2008 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Disposition matters: Volume, volatility, and price impact of a behavioral bias</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Goetzmann, William N.; Massa, Massimo

When disposition-prone investors increase their holdings in a stock, the volatility, volume, and the return of the stock all drop, as theory would predict. Exposure to a portfolio of stocks held by disposition-prone investors explains cross-sectional differences in daily returns, controlling for other factors and characteristics.

The objective is to define a limited number of stocks for the portfolio and to maintain it with minimal transaction costs.

In this article, the authors survey the bond-stock prediction model for five worldwide equity markets. This model is useful for predicting the time-varying equity risk premium (ERP) and for strategic asset allocation of bond-stock equity mixes. The focus is on the model's economic and financial implications and its application to the study of stock market strategies and corrections. The model has two versions. The first model, formulated more than 35 years ago by Ziemba and Schwartz, is the difference between the most liquid long bond, usually the 10- or 30-year bond, and the trailing equity yield. The idea is that asset allocation between stocks and bonds is related to their relative yields. When the bond yield is too high, a shift out of stocks into bonds can cause an equity market correction. This model predicted the 1987 2000, and 2002 corrections in the United States and the 1;90 correction in Japan. The second model and equivalent version, the Fed model, uses the ratio, or equivalently the logs, of the two yields, and has its origins in reports and statements from the Federal Reserve System under Alan Greenspan dating from about 1996. The ERP can thus be negative or positive and is, therefore, partially predictable. Despite its predictive ability, the bond-stock model has been criticized as being theoretically unsound because it compares a nominal quantity (the long-bond yield) with a real quantity (the earnings yield on stocks). Theoretical models of fairly priced equity indices can be derived and compared to actual index values to ascertain danger levels.</description><author>Berge, Klaus; Consigli, Giorgio; Ziemba, William T.</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2008 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>The concept of credit OAS in valuation of MBS</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Levin, Alexander; Davidson, Andrew
Neither the traditional option-adjusted spread (OAS) method nor a static loss forecasting is capable of providing a rational explanation of the pricing of traded asset-backed securities (ABS), credit default swaps, and loan protections. In this article, the authors introduce the concept of credit OAS, which revolves around the stochasticity of both interest rates and home prices. The credit OAS approach requires a risk-neutral stochastic model of home prices, a model of defaults and losses (theoretical or empirical), and a rigorous and efficient valuation scheme. The authors discuss how the risk-neutral conditions can be formed from concurrently observed prices of ABS tranches up and down the credit structure. An alternative is to analyze the cost of a GSE guarantee inclusive of capital requirements to support the guarantee. The authors illustrate their method with case studies in both liquid and illiquid markets. Even distressed market prices can be explained by a combination of modeled losses and a properly selected credit OAS level (i.e., liquidity spread). The greeks (risk measures), however, depend strongly on the modeling details (such as the link between interest rates and home prices), vary widely from model to model, and tend to be far away from traditional measures.</description><author>Levin, Alexander; Davidson, Andrew</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2008 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Portfolio investing with EVA</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Zaima, Janis K.
Investment strategy using the EVA metric has gained popularity, particularly with Fortune's publication of the top wealth creators as calculated by Stern Stewart &amp; Co. In this article, the author examines if portfolios created with higher EVA firms lead to higher returns. Two anomalies exist. First, negative EVA to market value (EVA-MV) firms earn, on average, the highest portfolio returns over a 10-year period. Second, the relationship between the EVA-MV ratio and portfolio returns is not linear, but U-shaped. However, when a reward-to-risk measure is utilized, a positive linear risk-return relationship prevails, providing evidence that the EVA-MV ratio is a proxy for risk.</description><author>Zaima, Janis K.</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2008 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Why have estimate revision measures not worked in recent years?</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Xu, Peter
Estimate revisions, whether measured using consensus or individual analyst data, continue to exhibit positive serial correlation. This suggests that the failure of estimate revision strategies in recent years was a result of investor overreaction to the widely known bias in analyst estimates. To measure this overreaction, the author presents a model that compares the persistence of estimate revisions expected by investors and the actual level of persistence warranted by analyst behavior. The results suggest that instead of simply selecting stocks with positive estimate revisions, the new task for active managers is to determine how much information in estimate revisions is already reflected in stock prices.</description><author>Xu, Peter</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2008 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Analyzing and estimating real stock returns</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Jones, Charles P.
What is the likelihood that real stock returns will average approximately 7% in the future, as they have done in the past? The author addresses this issue by analyzing the components of real stock returns over the period 1926 to 2005. The analysis allows investors to both understand real stock returns and make informed estimates of average real returns going forward. Although the typical case being made today for lower stock returns in the future is apparent, given today's significantly lower dividend yield, the author explores the conditions under which real returns can continue at their historical average. Using this framework, investors can easily substitute their expectations about real earnings growth and market valuations into the model to make intelligent estimates of average real returns over some future period.</description><author>Jones, Charles P.</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2008 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Greenspan vs. the gold standard</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Bernstein, Peter L.

Distressed debt is a large and growing segment of the fixed-income market. In this article, the authors expand the empirical basis for active management with evidence on risk and reward. They calculate a one-year default rate of 22% for the category, whether defined by spread or by price. That rate is more than 20 times as high as non-distressed speculative-grade debt. They also address the longstanding question of whether non-distressed investors should automatically take losses on bonds that fall below a stated price threshold. The evidence on price change argues against this strategy, based on a threshold of 70, but the cost of continuing to hold is a higher default rate than many investors can tolerate. Finally, a strong correlation indicates that distressed investors earn the highest returns on the lowest-priced bonds, but there is a severe penalty for selecting the wrong issues.</description><author>Fridson, Martin; Covey, Kevin P.; Sterling, Karen</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2008 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Determinants of stock prices: New international evidence</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>De Bondt, Gabe J.
In this article, the author presents a simple stock price model for major country economies. The model assumes a long-run fair stock market value and short-run deviations from fair value. In the long run, only fundamentals matter. In addition to the discussion of earnings and the risk-free interest rate, the author considers a proxy for the long-run equity risk premium. In the short run, other factors might determine stock prices, such as the exchange rate, commodity prices, momentum, and seasonality. Out-of-sample forecasting statistics indicate that the stock price model clearly outperforms a random walk model. Exploiting the forecasting accuracy in practice is difficult, however, because the stock price determinants, especially the short-run risk premium, are difficult to predict. By contrast, the long-run stock price model reliably guides investors about the degree of over- or undervaluation of stock markets from their long-run fair fundamental levels. Two different investment strategies illustrate the ability of the long-run stock price model to generate excess returns.</description><author>De Bondt, Gabe J.</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2008 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Fundamental indexation and international diversification</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Estrada, Javier
Just as fundamental indexation is novel and controversial, international diversification is traditional and widely accepted. In this article, the author links both issues and evaluates a fundamental strategy of international diversification. Considering 16 country benchmarks that make up over 93% of world market capitalization and a 32-year (1974-2005) sample period, the results show that a dividend-weighted fundamental index outperforms a cap-weighted index by the substantial margin of 190 bps a year. If, however, investors are willing to abandon cap-weighted portfolios, the results also show that a simple value strategy which weights the same country benchmarks by dividend yield outperforms the dividend-weighted fundamental index by 170 bps a year over the same period. All the strategies evaluated by the authors can be easily implemented with widely available low-cost country index funds and exchange-traded funds.</description><author>Estrada, Javier</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2008 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Correlation, return gaps, and the benefits of diversification</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Statman, Meir; Scheid, Jonathan
Correlation is the common indicator for the benefits of diversification, but it is not a good indicator for two reasons. First, the benefits of diversification depend not only on the correlation between returns, but also on the standard deviation of returns. Second, correlation does not provide an intuitive measure of the benefits of diversification. Return gaps are better indicators. A return gap is the difference in return between two assets or two portfolios. For example, as the authors show, the estimated 12-month return gap between the S&amp;P 500 Index and the Russell 2000 Index from February 2002 to January 2007 was 8.90%. This return gap implied that investors who concentrated their portfolios in one index or the other should have expected to lead or lag investors who diversified between the two in equal proportions by 4.45%. The realized 12-month return gaps ranged from 0.1% to 28.7%. It is difficult to intuitively deduce these figures from the relatively high 0.82 correlation between the two indices. Likewise, it is difficult to intuitively deduce from the relatively high 0.86 correlation between the S&amp;P 500 and EAFE indices that, over this same period, their estimated 12-month return gap was 6.86% and realized 12-month return gaps ranged from 1.8% to 23.0%. Moreover, the figures belie any claim that these assets' risk-reduction benefits have largely vanished.</description><author>Statman, Meir; Scheid, Jonathan</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2008 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Sharpe's state-preference approach and beyond: A practitioner overview</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Fogler, H. Russell
In his recent book, Nobel Prize-winner William Sharpe notes that, in contrast to MBA curricula focusing on the capital asset pricing model (CAPM), "[i]f you were to attend a Ph.D. finance class... you would learn about no-arbitrage pricing, state claim prices, complete markets, spanning, asset pricing kernels, stochastic discount factors, and risk-neutral probabilities." Sharpe's illustration of these concepts in a state-preference framework raises important questions for practitioners. Has the role of CAPM beta changed? Should investors still expect asset returns to be linear in beta as in the CAPM? What are the implications for other asset pricing models, such as arbitrage pricing theory (APT)? How does the state-preference framework clarify issues such as anomalies found by CAPM researchers, the peso problem, nonstationary volatility, tail risk, correlations going to unity in crises, smiles in option pricing, and the equity premium puzzle? The author provides an overview of Sharpe's work and addresses these practitioner questions.</description><author>Fogler, H.

The fields of psychology and sociology offer a large body of theory and evidence on how individual behavior differs from group behavior, particularly for performance and risk-taking activities. Relatively little attention, however, has been devoted to this topic in regard to managed portfolios, even though over 50% of mutual funds are managed by a team. In this article, the authors provide an empirical examination of whether funds managed by individuals perform differently from funds managed by teams. Using a sample of about 3,000 equity mutual funds over a 12-year horizon, the authors find that although the number of funds managed by teams has grown at seven times the rate of funds managed by individuals, no significant difference in risk-adjusted performance is observed between team-managed and individually managed funds. Funds managed by teams, however, are significantly less risky and exhibit lower turnover. In addition, the total cost of owning a team-managed mutual fund is, on average, nearly 50 bps lower per year than: the cost of owning an individually managed mutual fund. Finally, team-managed funds attract significantly greater investor flows than individually managed funds, even after controlling for performance, risk, and expenses.</description><author>Bliss, Richard T.; Potter, Mark E.; Schwarz, Christopher</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2008 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Dividends versus share repurchase: The stock price effect</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Bierman, Harold
To what extent should the board of directors and top management consider the immediate effect on stock price of the firm's distribution policy? The conclusions of this article are consistent with those of the well-known Black-Scholes option pricing model-a firm's underlying profitability affects its long-term stock price, not its dividend policy decisions. Beyond the short-run effect on investors who are selling the firm's shares, one should not consider the stock price effect of the distribution policy. If the stock price was initially a fair price, the firm cannot sustain the increased price because of the market psychology regarding a dividend increase. If an increased stock price were sustained, then the holders of the stock would earn below-market required returns.</description><author>Bierman, Harold</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2008 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>An assessment of terrorism-related investing strategies</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Karolyi, G. Andrew
Do terrorism-related investing strategies generate abnormal returns or risks? Employing two strategies for US. stocks over the past decade, the author finds that this is not the case. The first strategy evaluates a subportfolio of S&amp;P 500 stocks which is constructed based on a terrorism-related risk score that measures a company's degree of operations in countries with a high incidence of terrorism-related activity The second strategy evaluates a "terror-free" portfolio of S&amp;P 500 stocks that are screened based on the presence of a company's operations in countries deemed state sponsors of terrorism by the U.S. Department of State. The author finds that the terrorism-related risk exposure portfolio would have earned, on average, an economically small and statistically insignificant 16 bps premium per month with a tracking error of 2.8% per month and the terror-free portfolio would have earned an even smaller -1.6 bps premium per month with a tracking error of 25 bps per month. Return attribution analysis using a multifactor model uncovers interesting differences in systematic exposures to market risks and factors related to size, market-to-book ratios, and momentum.</description><author>Karolyi, G.

Modern options theory assumes that securities markets are complete and processes are known. But how should options be priced when markets are not complete and price processes are not known? The maximum-entropy framework, which formalizes the efficient market hypothesis, offers process-free option valuation in incomplete markets. This article reviews the gamma model for pricing stock options and the beta model for pricing bond options, both obtained in the maximum-entropy framework. Both models are as convenient as the Black-Scholes model, but unlike the Black-Scholes model they are valid in incomplete markets and do not restrict prices, interest rates, or volatilities to any specific paths. The gamma and beta models are both less restrictive and more accurate than alternative option valuation models.</description><author>Gulko, Les</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2008 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Expected return and risk of covered call strategies</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Figelman, Ilya
This article provides a theoretical framework for analyzing a covered-call stock index strategy relative to the underlying stock index itself. The framework proposed allows for the decomposition and explanation of the strong historical performance of covered call strategies, which has been documented in several other articles. Formulas for the expected return and risk (semi-standard deviation) of the covered call strategy are derived and empirical comparisons to the underlying stock index are provided. The author defines a new concept, the call risk premium, which is the difference between a call's real world expected value and its price. A key insight of this article is that investors considering a covered call strategy must consider the positive effect of the implied-realized volatility spread versus the negative effect of the equity risk premium. A second insight is that, as the time to call option expiration decreases, the volatility spread effect significantly strengthens and the equity risk premium effect slightly weakens. Hence, it is usually better to implement the covered call strategy with short-dated call options. This finding is consistent with the intuition of most practitioners.</description><author>Figelman, Ilya</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2008 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>How unlucky is 25-sigma?</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Dowd, Kevin; Cotter, John; Humphrey, Chris; Woods, Margaret

In the current deleveraging episode, the severity and simultaneous realization of low-probability events across a number of strategies has brought portfolio tail-risk hedging to the center of investors' attention. In this article, the author discusses the basic principles and implementation considerations behind portfolio tail-risk management, emphasizing the importance of viewing tail risk as the consequence of a systemic shock during which normally uncorrelated markets become correlated due to a reduction in liquidity. This approach suggests that tail risk should be measured by performing macro scenario analysis and that hedges should be picked based on their cost and joint performance in periods of stress relative to the portfolio being hedged. Since liquidity reduction is a typical consequence of systemic shocks, the author also discusses specific operational issues that come to the fore in such events.</description><author>Bhansali, Vineer</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2008 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Taming global village risk</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Sullivan, Rodney N.
Asset price bubbles build and burst today much as they have since modern capital markets first evolved some 300 years ago. In recent decades, although the real economy has become less volatile, the financial markets have not; they remain volatile and unpredictable. Exploring the driving forces behind market volatility provides investors a basis for an effective response in dealing with market risk. Markets are, in effect, complex adaptive systems. They are composed of a great number of decentralized decision makers who are continually digesting information and interacting in unanticipated and nonlinear ways. That markets are complex adaptive systems has critical implications for how we think about and manage investment risk. In risk management, we must focus on the market mechanisms driving capital markets to higher volatility, including the emotions of investors, complexity of adaptive markets, and advances in technology and mathematical modeling. Improving risk management means finding new tools to measure the interconnectedness of markets plus the total amount of systemic risk, leverage, and liquidity in the markets. With improvements in risk management, investors and regulators will be better equipped to mitigate the market volatility that often culminates in financial market instability.</description><author>Sullivan, Rodney N.</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2008 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Benchmarking measures of investment performance with perfect-foresight and bankrupt asset allocation strategies</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Grauer, Robert R.
It is well known that popular measures of investment Performance do not agree on the relative performance of passive portfolios, professionally managed funds, or various asset allocation strategies. In this article, the author shows that the problems are more fundamental. It benchmarks the performance measures against bankrupt asset allocation strategies that lose everything and perfect-foresight asset allocation strategies that yield returns beyond anyone's wildest dreams. Unbelievably, the risk-adjusted performance of some bankrupt strategies exceeds the risk-adjusted performance of all the perfect-foresight strategies! This occurs because the measures are based on average arithmetic returns which completely miss the fundamental importance of bankruptcy. Supplementing the measures with analyses of accumulated wealth, compound returns, or continuously compounded returns would alleviate the problem.</description><author>Grauer, Robert R.</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2008 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Toward the design of better equity benchmarks: Rehabilitating the tangency portfolio from modern portfolio theory</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Martellini, Lionel
Following recent research on the relevance of idiosyncratic risk in asset pricing models, the author proposes using total volatility as a model-free estimate of a stock's excess expected return and analyzes the implications, in terms of design, for improved equity benchmarks. The author finds that maximum Sharpe ratio portfolios are consistent with such expected return proxies and, if built upon improved estimates of the correlation parameters, will significantly outperform market cap-weighted schemes on a risk-adjusted basis. This analysis, which rehabilitates the role of the tangency portfolio from modern portfolio theory, suggests that better equity benchmarks can be designed, provided that a sophisticated portfolio optimization procedure is used that relies on robust estimates of moments and co-moments of stock return distributions. The article has important potential implications for the on-going debate about appropriate weighting schemes for equity indices.</description><author>Martellini, Lionel</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2008 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>On the fundamental law of active portfolio management: What happens if our estimates are wrong?</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Zhou, Guofu
The fundamental law of active portfolio management provides profound insights on the value creation process of managed funds and shows how forecasts of alphas or forecasting skins can be transformed into the value-added of an active portfolio. A key weakness of the law and its various extensions is that they ignore the estimation errors associated with the parameter inputs of the law. In this article, the author shows that the estimation errors have a substantial impact on the value-added and can easily destroy all the value promised by the law if not dealt with carefully. To minimize the impact of the estimation errors, the author proposes two methods-scaling and diversification. The scaling method scales the estimated optimal active portfolio by a suitable proportion to maximize the valued-added. The diversification approach suggests holding other portfolios along with the estimated optimal active portfolio in order to diversify away much of the estimation errors. The author shows that the two methods can be effectively used to minimize the impact of the estimation errors so as to substantially improve the valued-added.</description><author>Zhou, Guofu</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2008 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Do risk factors eat alphas?</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Lee, Jyh-Huei; Stefek, Dan
Although widespread, the practice in portfolio optimization of using different factor models for risk and alpha has potential pitfalls. Discrepancies between risk and alpha factors can create unintended exposures in optimized portfolios that may hamper performance. An analysis reveals the root of the problem. The optimizer emphasizes the portion of the manager's alpha that is not captured by the risk factors. Aligning the risk and alpha models may lead to better portfolios, even if doing so worsens the overall risk forecasts. In this article, four ways of remedying these problems are presented and compared using familiar optimization problems. The results are promising.</description><author>Lee, Jyh-Huei; Stefek, Dan</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2008 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>The impact of constraints on value-added</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Scherer, Bernd; Xu, Xiaodong

It is well known that the disappearance of hedge funds from a database may cause biases in estimating investment returns on these funds, although there is no consensus on why hedge funds stop reporting to data-gathering services. Some studies have suggested that poor or failing funds stop reporting, while others claim that it is the better-performing funds that stop reporting because they no longer need to attract new capital. Analysis of the TASS database reveals that hedge fund returns become significantly poorer at the end of a fund's reporting life. Other analysis here applies survival time techniques to examine funds' time to failure and changes in hazard rates (probabilities of failure) over time. Larger hedge funds and better-performing funds have lower hazard rates.</description><author>Grecu, Alex; Malkiel, Burton G.; Saha, Atanu</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 2007 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Do foreign exchange markets still trend?

Is it possible to trend-trade profitably in foreign currencies? Examination of both major or currency futures contracts that have been trading since the 1970s and more recent contracts on exotic currencies that have begun to trade only in the past several years shows that the era of easy profits in major foreign currencies from simple trend-following strategies is over. Trend-trading in a currency may have been advantageous in the early years of a floating-rate regime, but markets have adapted so that profits from these simple trading strategies have vanished. Newly trading currencies do appear susceptible to trend-following trading strategies, and there may remain in this case some attractive profit opportunities.</description><author>Pukthuanthong-Le, Kuntara; Levich, Richard M.; Thomas, Lee R.</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 2007 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>The volatility effect - Lower risk without lower return</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Blitz, David C.; van Vliet, Pim
There is empirical evidence that stocks with low historical volatility have high risk-adjusted returns, with annual alpha spreads of global low- versus high-volatility decile portfolios of 12 percentage points over 1986-2006. This volatility effect appears independently in U.S., European, and Japanese markets. It is similar in size to classic effects such as value, size, and momentum, and cannot be explained by implicit loadings on these well-known effects. These results indicate that equity investors overpay for risky stocks. Possible explanations include leverage restrictions, inefficient two-step investment processes, and behavioral biases of private investors. To exploit the volatility effect in practice, investors might include low-risk stocks as a separate asset class in the strategic asset allocation phase of the investment process.</description><author>Blitz, David C.; van Vliet, Pim</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 2007 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Original issue high-yield bonds - Explaining persistent underperformance</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Fridson, Martin; Sterling, Karen
In the past full market cycle, original issue high-yield bonds delivered no material total return premium over default risk-free Treasuries. This represents a bona fide market inefficiency that proved exploitable by one group engaged in actual market transactions; the corporate sellers of new issues escaped paying a default risk premium. Among the five complementary rather than mutually exclusive factors identified here that may explain this anomaly are: unawareness of the underperformance of the 01 segment; a focus on security selection; a lottery ticket effect; and the mirage of remedy based on yield. The discussion gets to the heart of the premise on which the high-yield investment concept was marketed at the dawn of its modern era in the late 1970s.</description><author>Fridson, Martin; Sterling, Karen</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 2007 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Divergent expectations - When investors agree to disagree</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Davis, Paul L.; Pagano, Michael S.; Schwartz, Robert A.
Investors who have the same information and interpret it differently are said to have divergent (as distinct from homogeneous) expectations. Financial economists generally frown on the divergent expectations assumption, even though it is critically important in describing reality. The idea of divergent expectations paves the way to understanding price and quantity discovery as major functions of a marketplace, and goes to the heart of important questions: What drives trading, and why does market structure matter? Many issues concerning market structure and market structure regulation should be analyzed in a divergent or heterogeneous expectations context, which has implications for market participants and public policy. We benefit from paying more attention to how asset managers behave.</description><author>Davis, Paul L.; Pagano, Michael S.; Schwartz, Robert A.</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 2007 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Taxation without replication - A look at a problem in synthetic indexing</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Chance, Don M.
It is well known that investors can structure derivatives portfolios to replicate a position in an underlying asset and synthetically create an index fund. While an individual investor can achieve perfect replication on a before-tax basis, taxes make derivatives inferior to direct investment in the index, because synthetically generated dividends and capital gains do not benefit from the preferential tax treatment accorded direct investment in the index. Derivative strategies also have lower after-tax expected returns and Sharpe ratios and are less volatile than the index. Option strategies benefit from a tax inequity favoring low exercise prices but are still inferior to direct investment in the index. Thus, synthetic indexing may be effective on a before-tax or non-taxable basis, but it falls for taxable individual investors because today's tax code disadvantages derivatives replicating strategies.</description><author>Chance, Don M.</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 2007 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Using binary variables to obtain small optimal portfolios - A quadratic integer programming resolution</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Charpin, Francoise; Lacaze, Dominique
Binary modeling may be used in order to constrain the, number of stocks in an optimal portfolio. Such modeling allows an exact resolution of the number problem raised by Jansen and van Dijk in an earlier issue; their solution is only approximate. Binary variable modeling allows imposition of a minimum threshold for portfolio weights, whether by itself or along with the numerical constraint.

Stock return momentum and reversal have been known for well over a decade. This work documents two new momentum effects that are even stronger than effects documented to date: yearly and quarterly periodicity. That is, in the long term, stock returns tend to follow a pattern every twelve months, and in the intermediate term to follow a pattern every three months. This analysis of the S&amp;P 500 over 1970-2004 includes examination of five momentum and reversal effects by industry, calendar month, and earnings announcement month.

Historical evidence suggests that accurate timing can reap huge potential profits in trading between large and small stocks. Artificial intelligence approaches-recursive partitioning, neural networks, and genetic algorithms-are an aid in development of size-timing strategies to decide when to be long or short with respect to the U.S. Fama-French small-minus-big portfolio. AI strategies are trained on both a static learning sample and on an expandable learning sample. The results here show that most AI strategies could successfully time the US. size premium over 1990-2004. When predictions differ, a consensus strategy, or one favored by two of the three AI approaches, outperforms the SMB strategy more systematically, and reduces transaction costs.</description><author>L'Her, Jean-Francois; Mouakhar, Tammam; Roberge, Mathieu</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 2007 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Information horizon, portfolio turnover, and optimal alpha models - Optimizing multiple factors for the best IR</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Qian, Edward; Sorensen, Eric H.; Hua, Ronald
The net value-added of an investment strategy has two parts: the expected value of the alpha skill, and the cost of implementation. The first part is positive and depends on the efficacy of a return forecasting model; the second is negative and depends on portfolio turnover and trading skills. The higher the former, and the lower the latter, the happier the investor. Typically, managers give little consideration to turnover, but throw an alpha model into an optimizer, setting turnover constraints to handle transaction costs. The explicit framework here instead integrates alpha models with portfolio turnover and transaction costs. The result allows evaluation of factors in terms of net return and then optimization of multiple factors to achieve the best net information ratio. Optimal multifactor models change as portfolio turnover constraints change, providing a potential solution for model evolution as assets under management grow.</description><author>Qian, Edward; Sorensen, Eric H.; Hua, Ronald</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 2007 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Dynamic portfolio analysis - Establishing a link between cause and effect</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Grinold, Richard
Dynamic portfolio analysis looks at the portfolio as a moving object to capture the essentials of a long-short investment management strategy. To see the forest rather than the trees requires simplifying assumptions, here a bare-bones two-parameter structure. One parameter measures the rate of information flow and the other the rate of trading in the portfolio. This framework yields informative results to explain the implementation efficiency of the strategy as well as the balance between the cost of trading and the benefit of trading. More significantly, it establishes a link between cause and effect. These notions can be used to engineer strategies, to analyze strategies, and to optimize the operation of strategies.</description><author>Grinold, Richard</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 2007 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>The surprising bond between CAPM and the meaning of liquidity</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Bernstein, Peter L.

Risk management is a challenge for hedge funds because traditional risk measurement methods based on return data are unreliable for dynamic trading strategies. Yet managers can still use value at risk (VaR) methods to measure and control the market risk of hedge funds. Two key VaR features enable this:VaR 1) is based on current position information, and 2) focuses on a lower quantile of the distribution of losses or some other risk metric. For rapidly changing positions, VaR should be measured at frequent intervals, as would be the case for banks' proprietary trading portfolios. An example demonstrates the usefulness of dynamic risk measures for a hypothetical hedge fund with short option positions. Imposition of daily ex ante VaR limits using position information can be successful in controlling realized risk.</description><author>Jorion, Philippe</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 2007 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>What does "Coming of age" mean?</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Bernstein, Peter L.

Real estate has gained wider acceptance as a legitimate institutional investment. The asset class continues to grow and adopt many of the features of the broader capital markets. International strategies, private equity strategies [with general partner - limited partner promoted fee structures], public REIT corporate governance, structured debt products (commercial mortgage-backed securities and commercial real estate collateralized debt obligations), hedge funds, as well as commercial real estate index-based derivatives are among the topics covered in this issue. Today real estate must compete in the alternative space with private equity, hedge funds, infrastructure and more. Yet, as several of the articles in this edition conclude, real estate retains its distinct features as an asset class; the role of real estate as a portfolio risk reducer looks sustainable over the long-term. Over long and short time periods, its return patterns are rarely in close synchronization with stocks and bonds, despite the adoption of the financial tools and techniques of the broader capital markets. This paradox-further integration with the broader capital markets, yet distinct and separate financial behavior-is the underlying theme of nearly all the articles in the issue.</description><author>Clayton, Jim; Gordon, Jacques; Fabozzi, Frank; Giliberto, S.

E.
The authors examine the relationship between the "external" governance index (G-Index) developed in a 2003 study Gompers et al. and performance of R-EITs in 2004 and 2006. The G-Index is a sum of takeover barriers instituted by individual R-EITs, and antitakeover provisions in the state of a firm's incorporation. For the sample of R-EITs studies, the G-Index ranges from 3 to 13, with an average of 8. When compared to firms in general, shareholder rights in R-EITs are stronger than unregulated firms. The analysis shows, as expected, a significantly negative impact of G-Index on REIT performance for 2004. However, the effect is diminished in 2006. The authors contend that this is due to the G-Index of R-EITs increasing between 2004 and 2006, creating clustering around the mean value in 2006. This would render the G-Index less important when comparing performance across firms. In view of the fact that hostile takeovers are rare among REITs, the low G-Index and the irrelevance of G-Index in more recent times suggests that external governance is ineffective for REITs. Thus, more attention should be paid to the efficacy to internal governance mechanisms.</description><author>Bianco, Candy; Ghosh, Chinmoy; Sirmans, C.

The compression of the commercial real estate risk premium</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Ruff, Jon
The spread of mortgage securitization and a decline in business-cycle volatility have reduced the traditional risks of holding commercial real estate. These secular factors, in turn, have contributed to record property valuations. Investors seem willing to pay higher prices for the same cash flows because they believe they can borrow at lower rates and count on stable cash flow from commercial rentals in a climate of comparative certainty The result has been a sharp compression of the risk premium on commercial real estate. No doubt, this phenomenon will in part prove to be cyclical. However, the evidence suggests that, long term, the commercial real estate risk prermium will remain below its historical average.</description><author>Ruff, Jon</author><pubDate>Sat, 01 Sep 2007 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Are hedge fund managers better able to forecast real estate security returns than others?

Collateralized debt obligations backed by commercial real estate (CPE CDOs) have quickly become an important and accepted part of commercial real estate finance. Issuers are drawn to CRE CDOs for efficient financing, and investors are drawn to the diversification benefits. The authors describe CRE CDOs, their evolution, current market trends, and historical performance. CRE CDOs give traditional real estate asset managers the flexibility to take advantage of relative value opportunities within the real estate market, while providing non-recourse financing that matches the average life and interest profile of the underlying asset pool. And as managers are drawn to CRE CDOs for structural flexibility and term financing, investors benefit from exposure to a diverse portfolio of managed CRE assets. As the CDO market continues to develop and evolve, there is an increasing number of managed CRE CDOs and CRE CDOs backed by commercial real estate loans. While this evolution brings new risks to CRE CDOs, it also provides new opportunities for investors. The authors also provide a framework for evaluating CRE CDO investments and discuss how rating agencies rate CRE CDOs.</description><author>Lucas, Douglas J.; Goodman, Laurie S.; Fabozzi, Frank J.; Manning, Rebecca J.</author><pubDate>Sat, 01 Sep 2007 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>What drives the return on CMBS? Likely by more than the commercial property market</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Xu, Xiaoqing Eleanor
Despite the significance of commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) as one of the fastest growing asset classes and the increasing interest in CMBS by institutional investors, available empirical evidence on CMBS is lacking. This article sheds light on the investment performance of CMBS, the driving forces behind CMBS return variability, and the relative importance of these variables in predicting CMBS returns. Using monthly data for the Lehman Brothers fixed income indices from January 1997 to June 2006, the author finds that mean return and total risk-adjusted return on investment-grade and high-yield CMBS. clearly dominate those on investment-grade and high-yield corporate bonds, Treasuries, and stocks. The autor uses a structural vector autoregressive (VAR) model to examine what drives the excess returns on CMBS and how. Impulse response analysis suggests that the growth in industrial production, inflation rate, change in 30-year mortgage rate, change in term structure spread, and excess return on the S&amp;P 500 all have a significant and inverse contemporaneous effects on the excess returns on investment-grade and high-yield CMBS. Variance decomposition reveals that the change in mortgage rate and the term structure spread together explain 57% and 44% of the variance in investment-grade and high-yield CMBS excess returns, respectively. Changes in the amount of CMBS issuance show a significant negative lag effect on CMBS excess returns. The required returns on CMBS are positively driven by the changes in credit spread, but this positive effect is much stronger for high-yield CMBS than for investment-grade CMBS.</description><author>Xu, Xiaoqing Eleanor</author><pubDate>Sat, 01 Sep 2007 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Stocks are from mars real estate is from venue - The cross-section of long-run investment performance</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Pai, Arvind; Geltner, David
How does the expected total return, or opportunity cost of capital (the discounted cash flow discount rate), differ across different types and locations of properties? This question is fundamental to institutional real estate investment portfolio and asset management. The cross-section of the long-run investment performance of real estate assets should be related to plausible measures of risk. The authors study this question using original, customized investment performance indexes constructed from the property-level NCREIF Index database. They find that a multi-factor model similar in structure to that of Fama and French predicts quite well the cross-section of long-run performance within NCPEIF But the real estate model is curiously opposite to that of the stock market.

The last several years have witnessed a significant shift among institutional real estate investors from "core" deals to "non-core" ventures. These non-core real estate transactions can be characterized as possessing one or more of the following traits: higher-return/higher-risk assets, greater leverage, shorter time horizons, and the use of a joint venture/operating partner. In this article, the author explores the pricing of non-core real estate investing by investigating three key aspects: 1) examining the impacts of financial leverage and demonstrating how the law of one price can be used to price non-core ventures by comparison to the core-with-leverage alternatives, 2) identifying the adverse effects of transaction costs upon investors' return (which worsen as the holding period shortens and/or the leverage ratio increases), and 3) describing the costs (e.g., because of the asymmetric nature of the operating partner's promote, computing the expected value of the promote using the venture's expected return understates the expected value of the promote) and benefits involved with the use of joint venture partners-as well as some of the agency costs these partners introduce. Finally, a preliminary examination of the NCREIF data suggests that the Joint-ventured office and industrial properties possibly provided investors with improved risk-adjusted rates of return. However, these conclusions are quite preliminary.</description><author>Paghari, Joseph L.</author><pubDate>Sat, 01 Sep 2007 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Pricing and index considerations in commercial real estate derivatives - Understanding the basics</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Geltner, David; Fisher, Jeffrey
It is important for participants in the nascent commercial real estate derivatives market to understand the fundamentals and the subtleties of the appraisal and transaction based indexes that underpin derivatives, as well as the proper pricing of derivatives taking into account the risk and return characteristics of the index. The authors review these considerations including the implications that appraisal lag in the index has for the equilibrium pricing of derivatives' such as index swaps, and the use of such vehicles for hedging real estate risk. An important conclusion is that even if the underlying index does not represent the current equilibrium in the property market or if the property market itself is not in equilibrium, we can still use equilibrium analysis in the derivatives market to derive a fair price for an appraisal index based derivative including consideration of the effect of any lagging and smoothing in the index. The analysis highlights informational issues about indexes and property markets that present both danger and opportunity for the facilitation of a well-functioning property derivatives market in the United States and shows how usage of derivatives needs to consider the effect of possible lag in the index.</description><author>Geltner, David; Fisher, Jeffrey</author><pubDate>Sat, 01 Sep 2007 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Smoothing and implications for asset allocation choices - Model selection or calibration?</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Marcato, Gianluca; Key, Tony
An extensive literature on smoothing issues in real estate markets has been published, covering a range of theoretical techniques, applications to indices and asset allocation. In this article, the authors focus on the practical implications of unsmoothing model selection and calibration for asset allocation decisions in the UK, US and Australian markets and sheds light upon contradictory results in previous studies. They find that different unsmoothing techniques yield very similar asset allocation choices. Identified portfolio weights are much more sensitive to the unsmoothing parameter than to the unsmoothing method. The authors conclude that research on smoothing should focus on the identification of the best parameter rather than on the specification of the model to be used. The empirical results reported are in line with previous studies with respect to the level of the unsmoothing parameter. Moreover, current weights of asset classes in institutional portfolios suggest a parameter maximzsing the portfolio's Sharpe ratio similar to the one identified in other studies. This result also has implications for the implied volatility of real estate markets.</description><author>Marcato, Gianluca; Key, Tony</author><pubDate>Sat, 01 Sep 2007 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Win private equity and hedge funds replace real estate in mixed-asset portfolios? Not likely</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Bond, Shaun A.; Hwang, Soosung; Mitchell, Paul; Satchell, Stephen E.
The role of commercial real estate in the investment portfolios of institutional investors is now well established, and allocations towards real estate are increasing. However, fund managers are also gaining interest in alternative asset classes such as hedge funds, private equity, commodities, and infrastructure. This raises the question of whether real estate could fall out of favor with institutional investors. To investigate this issue, the authors examine historical return data from a wide range of asset classes. They find strong support for increasing allocations towards real estate and that real estate has significantly better risk-hedging characteristics than any of the other asset classes studied.</description><author>Bond, Shaun A.; Hwang, Soosung; Mitchell, Paul; Satchell, Stephen E.</author><pubDate>Sat, 01 Sep 2007 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Private commercial real estate equity returns and inflation - New news on hedging power</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Huang, Haibo; Hudson-Wilson, Susan
The authors estimate, for total real estate and each of four property types, the extent to which various private commercial real estate returns, namely income, capital and total return, hedge against expected and unexpected inflation during the 1978-2006 period. Overall, total returns for all of the property types, except for retail, are shown to be a strong hedge against both expected and unexpected inflation. However, and interestingly, this hedging efficacy comes mostly from capital appreciation rather than income return. Thus the inflation hedging power of real estate seems to be more a product of the capital markets, rather than of the net income generating processes of real estate's leasing and expense structures. In terms of inflation hedging capability, office is shown to be the strongest, followed by apartment and warehouse. Contrary to past studies and conventional wisdom, the retail sector is shown to have no significant hedging power against inflation.</description><author>Huang, Haibo; Hudson-Wilson, Susan</author><pubDate>Sat, 01 Sep 2007 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Benefits of global diversification on a real estate portfolio - That free lunch</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Hastings, Adam; Nordby, Hans
Capital flows are increasingly global across all asset classes, including the real estate world. Because global real estate portfolios contain assets influenced by different national economies, with very different drivers, growth rates, and risk, the correlation of total returns between assets in these markets can be very low. Low or negative correlations provide the ultimate recipe for the "free lunch" of modern portfolio theory: returns that are the weighted average of assets within the portfolio, but volatility less than the weighted volatility of the individual assets. Unlike the case in domestic investments, however, the movement of foreign exchange rates must be considered, as unfavorable currency movements can severely hinder performance. Real estate is generally a long-hold investment strategy, but property income and ultimately the final selling price will be received in the local currency and must, at some point, be repatriated to U.S. dollars. The authors examine investments in global office properties, both with and without currency exchange rate factors, and make a compelling case for investment in the global office sector instead of investment only in the U.S. market.</description><author>Hastings, Adam; Nordby, Hans</author><pubDate>Sat, 01 Sep 2007 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Global commercial real estate - A strategic asset allocation study</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Idzorek, Thomas M.; Barad, Michael; Meier, Stephen L.
This article explores the role of global commercial real estate in a strategic asset allocation. Global REIT and listed real estate stock indices are used to proxy the broader direct and indirect equity global commercial real estate asset classes. In a historical analysis, using traditional mean-variance optimization the author finds that adding North American real estate dramatically improves the risk and return characteristics of the resulting asset allocations, while the addition of Asian and European real estate offers little improvement. In a set of forward-looking optimization using robust asset allocation tools such as reverse optimization, the Black-Litterman model, and resampled mean-variance optimization, it is observed that global commercial real estate should play a relatively large role in strategic asset allocation moving forward. Other contributions include the development of a working version of the market portfolio that includes global commercial real estate, an analysis of the overlap between popular equity asset class proxies and indirect real estate proxies, and recognition that the popularity of indirect real estate has confused asset allocators.</description><author>Idzorek, Thomas M.; Barad, Michael; Meier, Stephen L.</author><pubDate>Sat, 01 Sep 2007 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Should owners of Nasdaq stocks fear short-selling?

It is interesting to look at the daily association between market-adjusted returns of Nasdaq stocks and the percentages of trading volume attributable to dealers and to their speculator customers. An unusually detailed and informative set of Nasdaq trading records reveals significantly negative average market-adjusted returns when speculative short-selling exceeds 10%. At the more common (lower) levels of speculative short-selling, average market-adjusted returns tend to be near zero. Even when there is considerable speculative short-selling, the associated negative market-adjusted return is, on average, only 4 to 6 basis points for each percentage point of short-selling. For many stocks, days of high speculative short-selling are not typically days of unusually low market-adjusted returns. Finally, high levels of short-selling by Nasdaq dealers are more common for stocks earning relatively higher market-adjusted returns.</description><author>Christophe, Stephen E.; Ferri, Michael G.; Angel, James J.</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 2007 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Funds of hedge funds take the wrong risks - Sloppy manager selection and portfolio construction.</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Beckers, Stan; Curds, Ross; Weinberger, Simon
On average the fund of hedge funds industry over the last 15 years has delivered alpha with a high information ratio. Unfortunately, these alphas come with significant common-factor exposures for which the typical fund was unrewarded. While funds of hedge funds can deliver a valuable product, sloppy manager selection and portfolio construction typically result in less-than-pure alpha generation. A naive selection of a fund of hedge funds may thus lead to assuming relatively expensive common-factor exposure without necessarily accessing significant skill-based returns. A multifactor modeling of fund of hedge fund returns can help to identify skillful value-added.</description><author>Beckers, Stan; Curds, Ross; Weinberger, Simon</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 2007 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>The price of risk and the Heisenberg uncertainty principle</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Bernstein, Peter L.

The association between interest rate changes and stock returns has long been of interest to investors, all the more so recently as investors and the financial and popular press have zeroed in on the effect of Federal Reserve actions on interest rates. The interest rate sensitivity of common stocks can be measured using an alternative specification of duration, empirical duration, a measure that has become accepted by fixed-income analysts and portfolio managers. Analysis of the interest rate sensitivity of the aggregate stock market considers alternative economic sectors and many industries and stock indexes that reflect different sizes and investment styles. Five important results are documented: 1) dramatic changes over time in the empirical duration of common stocks; 2) substantial differences in the total-period empirical duration for different economic sectors and different industries; 3) a significant negative relation between market risk and interest rate risk for different industries; 4) significantly different patterns of empirical duration over time for different sectors and industries; and 5) differences in interest rate sensitivity for various economic sectors, industries, and investment styles that are generally consistent with economic expectations.</description><author>Reilly, Frank K.; Wright, David J.; Johnson, Robert R.</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 2007 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Putting economics (back) into quantitative models - The economic state of the world does matter.</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Bhansali, Vineer
Models devoid of strong economic underpinnings are seldom useful for practical real-world investment decisions. Models that differ in subtle ways in their underlying assumptions yield significantly conflicting results. Ignoring the fundamental relation between demand and supply dynamics can produce results that fail to hold in actual markets, and that often give but false comfort in risk measurement systems and inaccurate valuations. A parsimonious model of the term structure can incorporate economics without sacrificing theoretical rigor. Its risk-neutral term structure model parameters have a strong basis in widely followed macroeconomic variables, enabling extension to other markets such as the credit market.</description><author>Bhansali, Vineer</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 2007 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Value and growth, theory and practice - A fallacy that value beats growth.</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Brush, John S.
The definition of value-based investing is widely accepted by both academics and practitioners, but there is confusion and disagreement as to the definition of growth-based investing. There is some statistical support for generic value and growth multifactor ranking models. Given different holding-period sensitivities of alpha potential for value and growth, there appear to be two ways to exploit the two styles: the typical combining of pure styles in a portfolio, or the less widely recognized use of a combined value/growth model. One important conclusion is that active style exploitation of alpha is inherently incompatible with capitalization-weighted benchmarks.</description><author>Brush, John S.</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 2007 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Optimal execution for portfolio transitions - Minimizing opportunity cost.</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Kritzman, Mark; Myrgren, Simon; Page, Sebastien
Institutional investors periodically reallocate portfolios to shift the asset mix or change investment managers. These transitions are subject to a variety of costs, including commissions, opportunity cost, and market impact. Opportunity cost refers to adverse changes in price arising from exogenous market forces; market impact refers to adverse price movements that occur in response to the purchase and sale of securities. Opportunity cost and market impact costs represent the greatest share of transition costs, and investors influence these costs by how they trade. An algorithm may be used to deterrmine the optimal sequence and size of trades that minimize opportunity cost for portfolio transitions, provided that the trades are self-financing. Trades may be partitioned into smaller units to minimize market impact. This algorithm compares favorably to the industry norm, which is to minimize sector differences as a transition unfolds.</description><author>Kritzman, Mark; Myrgren, Simon; Page, Sebastien</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 2007 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Robust portfolio optimization - Recent trends and future directions.</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Fabozzi, Frank J.; Kolm, Petter N.; Pachamanova, Dessislava A.; Focardi, Sergio M.

Enhanced index investing involves tracking a benchmark index closely and using risk-controlled strategies to add modest value to the index. The typical approaches to construction of such portfolios involve subjective management judgments. A new approach to enhanced indexing instead formulates the problem as a dual-criteria goal programming problem. Unlike the traditional approaches, which require a fund manager to buy and sell stocks actively in order to improve returns, the proposed approach is based on the passive management of a small number of stocks. Empirical results from tests in the Taiwan stock market suggest the new approach incurs lower transaction costs and produces sustainable risk-control,led enhanced returns.</description><author>Wu, Liang-Chuan; Chou, Seng-Cho; Yang, Chau-Chen; Ong, Chorng-Shyong</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 2007 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Gathering implicit alphas in a beta world - New questions about alternative assets.</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Leibowitz, Martin; Bova, Anthony
Most US. institutional portfolios have surprisingly similar betas and similar overall volatilities. Beta assumes an implicit beta for each asset class that is based on its co-movement with US. equities. This "total beta exposure" to equities, as the primary risk factor in most portfolios, accounts for 90% or more of volatility even in highly diversified funds with a low explicit allocation to equities. The implicit beta values determine corresponding implicit alphas that can add to expected fund return and yet have a minimal impact on total fund volatility. These implicit alphas are passive, in that there is no presumption of a positive outcome from direct active investment. Unlike the zero-sum active alphas that presume superior investment skill and must be "hunted," the implicit alphas are passive and non-zero-sum in nature, and rather can be "gathered" through the allocation process.</description><author>Leibowitz, Martin; Bova, Anthony</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 2007 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Investment beliefs - Every asset manager should have them.</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Slager, Alfred; Koedijk, Kees
Increased transparency and a difficult environment for returns increase the importance of well-thought out investment policies for investors, clients, and trustees; a coherent set of investment beliefs provide the basis for a good investment policy. Investment beliefs improve stakeholder governance by reducing possible conflicts of interest, and affect the innovative adaptability of an organization by setting guidelines for best practice. A survey of published investment beliefs reveals three essential elements for investment beliefs: 1) a clear view of the capital markets (the inefficiencies to exploit, the risk/return relation, the relation between asset pricing and investment horizon); 2) a competent organization (cost-effectiveness, organization-specific values); and 3) a view on societal issues that affect investments (sustainable investments, corporate governance).</description><author>Slager, Alfred; Koedijk, Kees</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 2007 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Does size matter?

Total assets under management, or AUM in industry parlance, represents a prime criterion in virtually every manager search a large institutional investor undertakes today. Managers are typically required to have a minimum level of AUM to be considered in the early stages of any search process-institutional investors face so many agency risks that they usually conclude there is safety in higher numbers. This analysis of the historical impact of portfolio size on the performance of institutional asset management products uses a robust database of approximately 5,000 products that includes all the major public markets asset classes typically used by institutional investors. Accounting for both survivorship bias and backfill bias, the results indicate portfolio size has had a pervasive negative impact on performance across almost all the asset classes examined. Not surprisingly, the more illiquid asset classes (small-cap equities and high-yield bonds) have been the most negatively impacted by portfolio size.</description><author>Allen, Gregory C.</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 2007 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>The great alpha merry-go-round</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Bernstein, P.

Statistical factor modeling is often described as a way to identify commonality among returns in a financial market. Statistical models examine returns over many time periods, and from them identify relationships between and among the different assets, unlike fundamental factor models, which from the outset group assets that are likely to experience similar returns. Yet the statistical approach is better at finding some types of factors than others. Statistical factors generally work best with high-frequency return data, and even then may not pick up distinctions that apply to a relatively small subset of assets (such as distinctions associated with industry membership); they are most useful when they supplement fundamental factors. We see this in a case study that adds statistical factors to an MSCI Barra fundamental factor risk model.</description><author>Miller, G.</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jan 2006 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Attribution - Modeling asset characteristics as portfolios.</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Grinold, R.
This flexible, unified, and portfolio-centered approach to attribution treats attribution questions that occur before the fact (ex ante) and after the fact (ex post) symmetrically. Three important aspects of an analysis of a portfolio ex ante are its predicted risk, the information ratio (which measures the potential to add value), and the transfer coefficient (which shows the manager's ability to capture that potential). The product of these three variables is the portfolio's predicted alpha. Ex post analogues of these concepts are the predicted risk, the opportunity set (which shows how well the manager could do with perfect foresight), and the realized information coefficient (which measures the correlation between the forecast and the outcome). The product of these three quantities is the return of the portfolio. The author shows how to attribute the transfer coefficient and realized information coefficient to sources in a general manner.</description><author>Grinold, R.</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jan 2006 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>The paradox of the efficient market</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Bernstein, P.

Institutional fund managers generally rebalance using ad hoc methods such as calendar periods or tolerance band triggers. Another approach is to quantify the cost of a rebalancing strategy in terms of risk-adjusted returns net of transaction costs. An optimal rebalancing strategy that actively seeks to minimize that cost uses certainty-equivalents and the transaction costs associated with a policy to define a cost-to-go function. Stochastic programming is then used to minimize expected cost-to-go. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that the method outperforms traditional rebalancing strategies such as periodic and 5% tolerance rebalancing.</description><author>Sun, W.; Fan, A.; Chen, L.

Capacity is an intuitive concept linked to diseconomies scale in equity investing. As assets under management grow beyond realization of full economies of scale, liquidity and ownership constraints erode the ability of an equity investment strategy to add value. Two ways to estimate the capacity of a quantitatively managed equity strategy are proposed in a refined definition of the term. A controlled experiment to determine the effect on performance of varying only one variable assets under management-indicates capacity estimations are sensitive to various assumptions, first and foremost about market impact costs. Capacity should thus not be thought of as a specific number, but rather as a variable whose range must be estimated.</description><author>Vangelisti, M.</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jan 2006 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Managing guarantees - Providing protection but maintraining access to potentially higher returns.</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Dempster, M.

We have seen in recent years a significant growth in investment products aimed at investors who are worried about downside potential in the financial markets. One response is a dynamic stochastic optimization model for managing products with nominal or real guarantees. An optimal dynamic portfolio allocation strategy combined with risk management allows an institution to provide the best possible portfolio returns commensurate with clients' risk aversion. Implementation of such an investment strategy is illustrated using real market data and backtested through 1999-2004.</description><author>Dempster, M. A. H.; Germano, M.; Medova, E.

This study uses US. financial market data from the post-World War II era to examine whether the statistical evidence supports a flexible-weight asset allocation in U.S. financial markets. A variety of econometric tests are developed to estimate the speed of adjustment of economic time series data subject to unit roots and structural breaks. The findings suggest that successful flexible-weight asset allocation is likely to be difficult. Of all the relationships tested, only the long-term government bonds versus S&amp;P 500 relationship is cointegrated with a significant speed of adjustment parameter. This suggests a predictable long-run equilibrium relationship.</description><author>Coggin, T.

A portfolio approach is used here to analyze the value of financial disclosure to stockholders and the need for disclosure regulation. This demonstrates that in a portfolio context the degree of public financial disclosure does not influence a firm's value. Hence, if disclosure is costly, firms have no incentive to disclose information voluntarily. Under partial disclosure, however, investors select inefficient portfolios, implying a substantial welfare loss; hence, we need regulation. The analysis provides a framework for determining optimal disclosure from the point of view of social welfare.</description><author>Levy, M.; Benita, G.; Levy, H.</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jan 2006 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Calculating the price of bond convexity - No free alpha.

Market timing strategies using deviations from the long-run log consumption-wealth ratio (Cay) are tested to evaluate whether such strategies deliver superior investment performance. Several statistical tests indicate that true Cay embeds economically significant information about future market returns. At the same time, constraints such as the need to use the estimated rather than true ratio and delays in availability of macroeconomic data cast doubt on the likelihood that the market can be timed using mechanistic strategies based on Cay. Further research will ascertain whether it is possible to implement successful timing strategies using such a ratio.</description><author>Andrade, S.

Traditional approaches to the important sources of return in international equity investing attribute portfolio return to countries and global industries and styles. A new framework shows that these models miss an important component of return that arises from the unique behavior of industries and styles within markets. The answer to the perennial question of international investing-what matters more, country or global industry and style selection?-is quite different in developed and emerging markets. The oft-noted spike in the importance of global industries over country influence in 1998-2002 was likely a by-product of the technology bubble.

There are two basic methodologies for portfolio optimization: tracking error variance (TEV) minimization (the industry standard for indexing), and a cointegration-optimal strategy (advocated by econometricians). Cointegration is a statistical tool that seeks to exploit a long-run equilibrium relationship between a portfolio and a benchmark, ensuring that the two are connected in the long term. For simple index tracking, the additional feature of cointegration is found to provide no clear advantages or disadvantages over TEV Both models produce optimal portfolios that outperform a price-weighted benchmark during market crashes, assuming a long enough model calibration period. When tracking becomes more difficult, ensuring a cointegration relationship enhances performance. Cointegration-optimal portfolios dominate TEV equivalents for all the statistical arbitrage strategies based on enhanced indexation in all market circumstances.</description><author>Alexander, C.; Dimitriu, A.; Malik, A.</author><pubDate>Sat, 01 Jan 2005 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Index fundamentalism revisited - Redux - Results are attributable to value and small-stock premiums</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Kizer, J.; Malik, A.

Wavelet analysis represents a new approach to investigating the empirical relationship between the Sharpe ratio and the investment horizon for portfolios of small stocks, large stocks, and intermediate-term and long-term bonds. A wavelet multiscale approach decomposes a given time series on a scale-by-scale basis. Empirical results indicate that the wavelet variance declines as the wavelet scale increases, implying that an investor with a short investment horizon must respond to every fluctuation in realized returns, while an investor with a much longer horizon faces much less significant long-run risk associated with unknown expected returns. The long scale Sharpe ratio is much higher than the short scale, implying that the Sharpe ratio is not time-consistent. Finally, stock portfolios have higher Sharpe ratios than bond portfolios, except in certain-length periods, indicating that evaluation of the performance of stock and bond portfolios should account for investment horizon.</description><author>Kim, S.; In, F.; Malik, A.</author><pubDate>Sat, 01 Jan 2005 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Oops, our earnings were indeed preliminary - When preliminary earnings announcements and subsequent filings disagree</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Hollie, D.; Livnat, J.; Segal, B.; Malik, A.

Highly illiquid and non-traded investments-such as private real estate, leveraged buyouts, and venture capital-have historically been very hard to compare to traditional investments. This is particularly problematical when one considers how to include these assets in a traditional portfolio of assets. For the purposes of asset allocation, it is critical that illiquid asset classes are made comparable to liquid asset classes. An estimation procedure here may help to assess the true risks and diversification benefits presented by illiquid asset classes more accurately. Even though the approach involves some assumptions, it should provide a better picture of the variations in illiquid returns.</description><author>Budhraja, V.; de Figueiredo, R. J.

Statistical analysis of interest rate forecasts published in the Wall Street Journal since. 1981 suggests that investors do not need to be rational for market prices to be efficient. A market populated by imperfect agents can be efficient if there are enough agents and they are suitably interconnected. That is, numbers and interaction compensate for individual imperfections. A maximum-likelihood model of a market inhabited by irrational heterogeneous investors produces a distribution of interest rate forecasts that agrees with the Wall Street Journal polls.

Liberalization of capital markets in emerging markets in the last two decades has made these countries' equity markets increasingly responsive to world factors. One of the implications of globalization for international asset allocation is that global portfolio managers can no longer add significant value by pursuing indexing strategies in emerging markets. Empirical analysis shows there are no significant gains from an aggregate investment in emerging market equities, although portfolio managers can achieve enhanced performance by specialized investment in some markets, instead of indexing across all emerging markets. Aggregate diversification across all emerging markets is no longer enough to create value.

Here are some practical perspectives on momentum investing in stocks internationally. Momentum is generally more profitable on the long side than on the short side, making it accessible to a broad range of institutional capital, and both price and earnings momentum profits are significant globally. Earnings momentum internationally is distinct from price momentum; using price and earnings momentum in conjunction produces greater economic profits. Momentum profits co-move more weakly across markets than market indexes. Interestingly, while market correlations are much higher in down markets than in up markets, momentum correlations are low under both market conditions. There is no appreciable difference in momentum strategy profitability in up and down markets, which means timing is less important to momentum traders. Finally, momentum strategies are not riskless-there are often periods of several months when they have netted low or negative returns. The findings altogether suggest that momentum is useful in international portfolio management, but it should be implemented very thoughtfully.</description><author>Griffin, J. M.; Ji, X.

Social norms, including rules of fairness, are rules of behavior enforced by the community that often make their way into law. Community rules of fairness in financial trading are important to everyone, but they are especially important to investors, to executives, to investment professionals, to students who plan to become executives or investment professionals, and to regulatory agencies such as the Securities and Exchange Commission. Surveys of both investment professionals and students illuminate some rules of fairness. Rules of fairness are found to allow a trader to gain advantage over another with information obtained with research, skill, or even luck, but not to gain advantage with inside information that other traders cannot obtain with research or skill. Rules of fairness place special burdens on traders who are relatively well-off and traders who have sure information.

Real estate for institutional investors is most broadly defined to comprise private commercial real estate equity, private commercial real estate debt, public real estate equity structured as real estate investment trusts or real estate operating companies, and public commercial real estate debt structured as commercial mortgage-backed securities. Arguments made in a 2003 special issue of this journal for adding real estate to a well-managed institutional investment portfolio include: portfolio diversification and risk reduction, absolute return enhancement, inflation hedging, reflection of the investment universe, and strong cash flows. A revisit of these portfolio issues and an updated empirical analysis continue to support the rationale for real estate. Particular challenges face institutional investors who invest in real estate; the articles in this 2005 special issue address them.</description><author>Hudson-Wilson, S.; Gordon, J. N.; Fabozzi, F.

Traditional portfolio theory assumes that risk factors are elliptically distributed, when most real-world risk factors do not satisfy this condition. The lack of ellipticality poses two problems: First, correlation-based approaches to statistical dependence become unreliable, and second, conventional risk measures such as the standard deviation and value at risk also become unreliable. These problems can be dealt with by using copulas to handle dependence and by using coherent risk measures. The advantages of using copulas are demonstrated in an example that shows that traditional portfolio theory can also be misleading in a non-elliptical context.</description><author>Dowd, K.</author><pubDate>Sat, 01 Jan 2005 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>The symmetric downside-risk Sharpe ratio - And the evaluation of great investors and speculators.</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Ziemba, W.

The Sharpe ratio, a most useful measure of investment performance, has the disadvantage that it is based on mean-variance theory and thus is valid basically only for quadratic preferences or normal distributions. Hence skewed investment returns can engender misleading conclusions. This is especially true for superior investors with a number of high returns. Many of these superior investors use capital growth wagering ideas to implement their strategies, which means higher growth rates but also higher variability of wealth. A simple modification of the Sharpe ratio to assume that the upside deviation is identical to the downside risk gives more realistic results.</description><author>Ziemba, W.

Most corporate bond portfolio managers use fundamental credit analysis in the security selection process and some form of the efficient frontier in the construction and ongoing management of their portfolios. This traditional approach, however, does not take into account the whole distribution of potential future credit losses on the portfolio and thus does not capture the risk of extreme events. A remedy is to apply the methodology used in the construction of collateralized debt obligations to analyze and manage the tail risk in corporate bond portfolios.</description><author>Jacob, D.

We have a pension funding problem. The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation is today exceedingly vulnerable. Too many of the proposals to reduce this vulnerability, protect plan participants, and encourage plan sponsors to stay in the game amount to special pleadings for some stakeholders, typically at the expense of others. Some other proposals promise a free lunch fueled by risky investments, deferrals of cost, and optimistic expectations. Pension plans can become and remain fully funded at all times after a suitable, although not necessarily rapid, transition. One way to introduce transparency and objectivity is through securitization, creating capital market-based transition securities that mimic the current relationships between defined-benefit pension plans and their corporate sponsors and the PBGC.</description><author>Gold, J.</author><pubDate>Sat, 01 Jan 2005 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Toward an optimal domestic large-cap equity index - Choice of a benchmark is critical.</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Seegopaul, H.; Gupta, F.; Prestbo, J.
Choosing a benchmark for domestic large-cap equities is critical for plan sponsors because benchmarks play an important role in of the portfolio management decision. As the sole purpose of active management is to generate excess returns over the benchmark, it is important that an equity benchmark representing this asset class be efficient, so that any outperformance of an active manager can be considered an outcome of the manager's skill. A more efficient benchmark for large-cap equity results in a historical average information ratio of zero for the universe of active managers. The key to generating alpha in this asset class then depends on one's ability to identify skillful managers.</description><author>Seegopaul, H.; Gupta, F.; Prestbo, J.</author><pubDate>Sat, 01 Jan 2005 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>If you had everything computationally ... - Where would you put it, financially?</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Leinweber, D.

N.; Shaffer, J. S.
Managers, sponsors, and consultants all have an interest in understanding the capacity of investment products. Capacity is the maximum asset level at which a product can deliver the expected performance (on average) over time. A framework for analyzing capacity should be useful for understanding its driving forces. Under transaction cost-aware portfolio management, expected alpha net of costs turns out to decay very slowly with increasing asset levels; large errors in estimated capacity lead to only small errors in expected alpha net of costs. Building portfolios without regard to costs, however, leads to substantially lower capacity. Negative returns do not necessarily signify capacity problems, but increasing costs usually signify suboptimal portfolio management. Asset growth should be managed and size regularly compared with available capacity. Managers can increase capacity by improving their intrinsic information ratio and by reducing transaction costs, perhaps through better approaches to trading.</description><author>Kahn, R.

Investors have views on both factor returns and stock-specific returns, and the results they achieve may reflect both return components to varying degrees. Attempting to eliminate the impact of a particular factor may not be desirable. Application of an analytical framework to consider the potential deterioration in investment performance suggests a substantial loss in information ratio due to enforcement of factor neutrality, particularly with a limited number of stocks in a portfolio, as is often the case in the real world. The IR may be affected even if all information available is on stock-specific returns, when different universes are used to estimate the factor structure and to construct the portfolio.

Application of a multifactor alpha model across a diverse range of stocks is a popular way to forecast security expected returns, but it is a one-size-fits-all approach. An alternative alpha-modeling approach represents a parsimonious way to model securities individually in order to capture idiosyncratic return behavior in different security contexts. The investment objective is information ratio maximization through optimal alpha factor weights. This technique demonstrates the importance of factor categories such as cheapness, quality, and sentiment that vary significantly across various security contexts.

G.; de Silva, H.; Murdock, R.
The typical asset allocation decision focuses on gaining exposure to systematic market risks such as equity, interest rate, and credit risk. Investors also often explicitly manage their exposure to firm-specific characteristics like size, book-to-market, or momentum. For a global portfolio, we can add another category of exposures not correlated with systematic market risks and firm-specific characteristics: global market factors that explain the cross-section of returns across individual equity, fixed income, and currency markets. Portfolios constructed to include exposures to each of these three categories of risk and return seem to be more efficient at producing diversified returns than those limited to just systematic market risks. Using this factor-based approach to asset allocation results in optimal portfolios with significantly less exposure to equity market risk than the typical institutional portfolio generated using the traditional asset allocation approach.</description><author>Clarke, R.

P.; Manzi, J. M.
Credit-enhancing features and underwriting standards in commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) transactions have evolved over time since the market developed in the early 1990s. With the positive performance of commercial real estate, the boom in capital flowing into the sector, and competition among new entrants to the market, lenders have become more flexible with regard to loan terms, enabling CMBS to be sold at reduced credit enhancement levels. The competition among market players, old and new, suggests that the trend toward more relaxed lending standards may not reverse itself any time soon (not a concern as long as investors are compensated for the additional risk). While these trends are not unique to CMBS, the best strategy for an investor who has to be in the bond markets (short of moving into Treasuries) is to compare spreads across different sectors and adjust for credit enhancement and expected credit experience.</description><author>Jacob, D.

Real estate opportunity funds are one of the fastest-growing segments of the real estate investment industry, similar in some basic respects to other private equity and alternative investment asset classes that seek high returns by taking on more risk in highly illiquid private investments. Opportunity funds rely heavily on the skill and expertise of the fund managers, prompting a question as to whether subsequent real estate opportunity funds launched by the same manager display persistent performance. Despite strong evidence of persistence, such relative performance appears to be mean-reverting or even reversing over longer periods between fund launches. There is less persistence in returns net of management fees, suggesting that successful managers can effectively charge higher fees on subsequent funds.</description><author>Hahn, T.

Private real estate returns cannot be explained adequately by alpha and beta alone. The fact that so many real estate managers claim positive and persistent alpha performance versus the NCREIF benchmark seems simply unbelievable to public securities investors, who know that alpha is a zero-sum game. Perhaps this outperformance is simply the result of value creation strategies such as new development or redevelopment, something that can occur only in private market investing strategies that allow the investor to take control of the asset. This third component of return-value creation-is here called gamma, making the real estate portfolio return equation equal beta + alpha + gamma. An analytic approach to such three-way performance attribution indicates that gamma is likely a much more powerful explanation of private equity portfolio outperformance than alpha could ever be.</description><author>Kaiser, R.

Investments in stand-alone centers occupied by big-box retailers do poorly as a hedge against changes in the variables that generally matter to institutional investors. The. reason is structural. Big-box retailer leases often include a go-dark option allowing the retail tenant to vacate its space before expiration of the lease. This tends to occur under high inflation (and hence the big-box retailer cash flow growth rate is high) and under high uncertainty, exactly the conditions under which institutional investors most need high returns.</description><author>Shilling, J.

Much of the literature on the pricing of commercial mortgages underlying commercial mortgage-backed securities pools focuses on the effect of term default (default during the term of the loan), and ignores the possibility of balloon risk, the borrower's inability to pay off the mortgage at maturity through refinancing or property sale. A contingent-claims mortgage pricing model that includes two default triggers-a cash flow trigger and an asset value trigger-may be used to assess the effect of balloon risk on the pricing of CMBS tranches. Simulations of cash flows for individual loans in a CMBS framework reveal how individual tranches are affected by balloon risk. Balloon risk is low at the whole-loan level, but under a number of scenarios total credit risk and balloon risk creep into investment-grade CMBS tranches and significantly impact their valuation.</description><author>Eppli, M.

Private commercial real estate equity held as an individual asset or in commingled vehicles represents one of the four real estate sectors for institutional investors. Within the sector are three primary strategies: core, value-added, and opportunistic. Core properties are well-positioned real estate properties with high occupancy rates and stable cash flows. Core properties are at the lower end of the risk and return spectrum where capital gain is secondary to income generation. At the opposite end of the spectrum are opportunistic properties, which are characterized by low or unreliable income streams but great potential for appreciation. Value-added properties have mixed characteristics, and lie between the two extremes of core and opportunistic properties. One significant problem for investors in the private equity sector is valuation.</description><author>Anson, M. J. P.; Hudson-Wilson, S.; Fabozzi, F.

It is axiomatic that all real estate is local. The question is whether very local submarkets within an MSA behave differently in terms of their fundamentals, and if so whether this behavior is priced appropriately so that total investor returns are approximately the same across locations. Longterm data on the market fundamentals of a large sample of Atlanta apartments combined with more recent data on sales transactions allow these authors to produce very accurate capitalization rates or yields. Market absorption, construction, and short-term vacancy vary across submarkets and are particularly volatile. Despite these differences, submarket rents move much more smoothly, although different areas are different in long-term rental growth, and the differences in performance are close to perfectly priced. In areas with higher rent growth and declining vacancy, yields are lower to the extent that theory would suggest.</description><author>Wheaton, W.

Hedge funds have return peculiarities not commonly associated with traditional investment vehicles. They are more inclined to produce return distributions with significantly non-normal skewness and kurtosis. Investor preferences may be better represented by bilinear utility functions or S-shaped value functions than by neoclassical utility functions, and mean-variance optimization is thus not appropriate for forming portfolios that include hedge funds. Portfolios of hedge funds formed using both mean-variance and full-scale optimization, given a wide range of assumptions about investor preferences, reveal that higher moments of hedge funds do not meaningfully compromise the efficacy of mean-variance optimization if investors have power utility; mean-variance optimization is not particularly effective for identifying optimal hedge fund allocations if preferences are bilinear or S-shaped; and, contrary to conventional wisdom, investors with S-shaped preferences are attracted to kurtosis as well as negative skewness.</description><author>Cremers, J.

Thus, the superior performance of Vanguard's managed portfolio was due entirely to its tendency to over-weight small stocks and value stocks relative to the index portfolio during a period when stocks with these two characteristics outperformed the market. So, it is style-picking skill rather than stock-picking skill that leads to the superiority of the managed portfolio in this particular instance.

There is a negative and statistically significant relationship between the returns of the S&amp;P 100 and the Nasdaq 100 stock indexes and their corresponding implied volatility indexes, VIX and VXN. For the S&amp;P 100, the relationship is asymmetric, as negative stock index returns are more associated than positive returns with greater changes in VIX. VIX changes when negative stock index returns are observed are greater in low-volatility periods. For the Nasdaq 100, the asymmetric effect is rather weak, but the VXN and underlying index co-movement is also somewhat muted in high-volatility trading environments.

Volatility forecasts crucial to many financial applications usually assume implicitly that the frequency of the data should match the forecast horizon; portfolio managers typically rely on risk models estimated using monthly data to produce monthly volatility forecasts, for example. For longer-term forecasts, this practice has two drawbacks: Volatility estimates can be based on stale data; and return events occurring within long sampling intervals are obscured, confounding estimation.

Return correlations in the U.S. dollar and euro credit markets are systematically different on at least two dimensions: returns for normal day-to-day spread changes versus spread returns associated with extreme events; and spread returns for investment-grade versus speculative issuers. A large part of the return correlation is driven by extreme global events such as the 2001 terrorist attacks or the 2002 credit crisis ensuing on the Enron meltdown. Under more normal market conditions, euro and U.S. dollar credit markets are weakly linked, especially for highly rated debt. Returns on speculative debt issued by the same issuer in different markets tend to be highly correlated; this is less so for high-grade issuers. An immediate implication is that currency diversification is much more efficient than name diversification for high-grade debt. Conversely, high-yield portfolios benefit from name or even sector diversification more than they benefit from currency diversification. Risk models need to include currency-dependent factors, particularly for investment-grade instruments. The results provide some indication of the way to use global credit factors or factor return proxies to estimate credit risk in markets lacking much corporate bond data.</description><author>Breger, L.; Stovel, D.</author><pubDate>Sat, 01 Jan 2005 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>A la carte prepayments - The menu-driven approach.</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Bhattacharya, A.

A key component in the valuation of mortgage-backed securities that distinguishes them from bullet fixed-income securities is the prepayment behavior of the underlying mortgages. Increased liquidity of NIBS markets has led to increased market efficiency, making the pricing of different types of customized MBS an important function of the underlying loan prepayment profiles. Lower-balance MBS, which prepay more slowly, are offered at a premium over to-be-announced (TBA) MBS, for example. Many other property and obligor attributes that determine prepayment should be considered in aggregate MBS valuation. A prepayment examination of the underlying loans provides a systematic way to analyze the variation in pay-ups (or concession) of customized MBS to TBAs.</description><author>Bhattacharya, A.

P.
Overseers of endowments and long-duration trusts should focus on how they can use cash from these funds to serve the owners' or beneficiaries' current spending needs without a negative impact on future withdrawals to meet future spending needs. As the ultimate objective of all investment portfolios is to provide spendable cash over some time frame particular to the owner's or beneficiary's circumstances, paying attention to the fecundity, or the fruitfulness, of long-duration portfolios would seem to make good sense. Cash withdrawals, effectively the fruit of a portfolio, can come from dividends, interest, portfolio asset sales, or some combination of all three. A focus on the fecundity of a typical endowment or long-duration trust fund leads to several useful insights.</description><author>Garland, J.

The fixed-income portfolio strategy investigated here is designed to generate positive returns and be completely risk-based; it does not require any forecasts about future yield curve movements, The idea is to control the shortfall risk of a fixed-income portfolio dynamically, allowing portfolio managers to spend their available risk budgets flexibly (taking duration, yield curve, and credit positions). The total risk of the portfolio is adjusted on a daily basis to produce positive total returns (or a total return above a prespecified mimmum-return threshold).</description><author>Herold, U.; Maurer, R.; Purschaker, N.</author><pubDate>Sat, 01 Jan 2005 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Five myths of active portfolio management - Most active managers are skilled.</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Berk, J.

Five myths are debunked here. It is not true that: the return investors earn in an actively managed fund measures the skill level of the manager; the average active manager is not skilled and therefore does not add value; if managers are skilled their returns should persist-they should be able to consistently beat the market; in light of evidence that there is little or no persistence in actively managed funds' returns, investors who pick funds on the basis of past returns are not behaving rationally; and finally, because most active managers' compensation does not depend on the return they generate, their compensation is not performance-based.</description><author>Berk, J.

C.; Fleishman, B. A.
Growth investing in international stocks is very different from growth investing in U.S. stocks. The tracking error between international growth and value returns has been significantly lower than the tracking error between U.S. growth and U.S. value returns. Therefore a portfolio consisting of both international growth and international value equities, as defined by EAFE, has offered less portfolio diversification than a portfolio consisting of both U.S. growth and value equities. An alternative strategy is an international growth portfolio with substantial investments in small-capitalization and emerging markets stocks, two asset classes that offer the potential for higher returns than the MSCI EAFE Growth index, with lower correlations to the MSCI EAFE Value index.</description><author>Pozen, R.

Active managers of small-cap U.S. equity portfolios have consistently and significantly outperformed the Russell 2000 over the past 20 years, while active managers of large-cap U.S. equity portfolios have barely kept pace with the Russell 1000. Is small-cap a less efficient market, and a more productive place to spend active risk capital? A robust database of over 780 institutional small-cap managers allows examination of the historical behavior of the small-cap premium over the last 20 years. After taking into account survivorship bias, instant history bias, and a mild large-cap growth bias in the universe, we see the small-cap active management premium seems to have been significant and consistent over the period.</description><author>Allen, G.

A new portfolio theory takes into account the non-Gaussian properties of asset returns. The non-Gaussian properties of a portfolio are quantified by the so-called moments and cumulants of its distribution of returns. Generalizing the concept of efficient frontiers, the non-Gaussian efficient frontier depends on the chosen risk measure, corresponding to different orders or combinations of centered moments or cumulants. These extended formulas let investors analyze the conditions under which it is possible to have one's cake and eat it too, in order to construct a portfolio with both higher return and fewer major risks.</description><author>Malevergne, Y.; Sornette, D.</author><pubDate>Sat, 01 Jan 2005 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>New frontiers in compliance</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Samuelson, P.; Schulman, E.

Institutional portfolio management has two main goals: 1) to implement the policy risk of the institutional fund as efficiently as possible, and 2) to add value. While these two goals may be accomplished by beta drivers and alpha drivers, asset managers often attempt to extract alpha from beta drivers. This leads to expensive products that add more beta than alpha. To better manage institutional portfolios, beta products must be separated from alpha products, so that the two goals can be accomplished more effectively. This has implications both for the types of products produced by money managers and the types of products purchased by the institutional investor's staff.</description><author>Anson, M.</author><pubDate>Sat, 01 Jan 2005 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Quantitative topics in hedge fund investing</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Liew, J.; French, C.
There are five current topics in hedge fund investing examined here. First is that investors should use multifactor models with observable market factors when they attempt to separate alpha from beta. Second, it is important to test for the positive serial correlation in hedge fund returns that remains a pervasive problem. Third, there are some difficulties in applying academic techniques to portfolio construction, but several pragmatic solutions may be able to overcome them. Fourth, manager selection may be more important than strategy allocation for hedge fund investing.

E.
Hedge funds fit in an institutional investor's portfolio only if one can evaluate how the inclusion of hedge fund strategies would improve the performance of the entire portfolio, after considering both beta and alpha characteristics. This is more challenging than it first appears because of the opaqueness and the complexity of most hedge fund strategies. The key is to identify institutional-quality hedge funds that permit a clear understanding of the normal portfolio and provide confidence in projecting a positive, pure alpha. If these conditions can be satisfied, there are two possible approaches to incorporating institutional-quality hedge funds: 1) hedge funds as an active overlay at the total portfolio level, or 2) hedge funds as portable alpha within a traditional asset class.</description><author>Dopfel, F.

An empirical regularity in the portfolio diversification literature is the importance of country effects in explaining international return variation. A new decomposition here disaggregates these country effects into region effects and within-region country effects. Half of the return variation typically attributed to country effects seems attributable actually to region effects, a result robust across developed and emerging markets; the remaining variation is explained by within-region country effects. For the average investor, this means that diversifying across countries within Europe, for example, delivers half the risk reduction possible from diversifying across regions globally.</description><author>Brooks, R.; Del Negro, M.</author><pubDate>Sat, 01 Jan 2005 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>The P/B-ROE valuation model revisited</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Wilcox, J.

A two-stage stock valuation model derived from the P/B-ROE approach is shown to be a surprisingly effective tool for a broad variety of uses, including the explanation of current prices and the prediction of future return differences. This applies both to the cross-section of individual U.S. stocks and the time series of the S&amp;P 500 index. Besides offering a new closed-form expression for firm value, the model measures the investment horizon over which the market predicts exceptional profitability, demonstrates the dependence of expectations for future profitability on past volatility of return on equity, and quantifies the extent of the recent U.S. stock price bubble. Perhaps the model's most persuasive result is its no-look-ahead statistical support for tactical asset allocation.</description><author>Wilcox, J. W.; Philips, T.

This exploration of risk-neutrahty in MBS prepayments introduces option-adjusted valuation of MBS with consideration of prepayment risk, i.e., the risk that future prepay speeds systematically drift away from a model. A new measure, prepayment risk- and option-adjusted spread (prOAS), is suggested to replace the traditional option-adjusted spread, which varies widely across instruments. PrOAS levels the playing field by assuming that all liquid NIBS and their derivatives are traded flat to the same debenture curve, on a risk- and option-adjusted basis. There are two alternative and theoretically equivalent methods of pricing with prOAS: 1) solving pricing PDEs with risk terms explicitly for pass-throughs using the active-passive decomposed prepay model, and 2) using a risk-neutral prepayment model, which is more universal. Although the prOAS method generally works well in case studies, there are some exaggerated dynamics of prices of risk and market dislocation in times of panic that offer arbitrage opportunities.</description><author>Levin, A.; Davidson, A.</author><pubDate>Sat, 01 Jan 2005 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Simulated credit loss distribution</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Ramaswamy, S.
Standard portfolio credit risk models provide an assessment of the potential credit loss that could result from changes to the credit quality of different obligors held in a bond portfolio. In practice, a significant portion of the credit loss can also result from changes to credit spreads that may or may not be directly related to the obligor's creditworthiness. Comparison of the simulated credit loss distribution for an investment-grade corporate bond portfolio generated using standard credit risk models and the historical credit loss distribution of a similar portfolio indicates that the two are quite dissimilar. Several modifications can be made to the standard portfolio credit risk model to reduce this discrepancy.</description><author>Ramaswamy, S.</author><pubDate>Sat, 01 Jan 2005 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Nasdaq's closing cross</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Pagano, M.

On March 29, 2004, Nasdaq significantly expanded its hybrid market structure by introducing the closing cross, an electronic price discovery call auction that sets closing trades and establishes official closing prices. Three months later, on June 25, the efficiency of the new facility was stress-tested by the Russell 2000 rebalancing, an event that involved almost 1,700 Nasdaq stocks. The efficiency of the closing cross can be analyzed by comparing price dislocations experienced at the 2004 rebalancing with those observed at the 2003 rebalancing. By and large, the findings suggest that the closing procedure is effective, especially for the smaller-cap stocks in the Russell 2000 index.</description><author>Pagano, M. S.; Schwartz, R.

Postings on Internet discussion boards provide an unusual opportunity to explore the sociological mechanics underlying the impounding of information into stock prices and to examine any implications for portfolio construction. Graph-theoretic techniques applied to contacts across the web network of stock discussion allow classification of stocks into two types: communities of connected stocks, and disconnected stocks. Connected stocks outperform others in a risk-adjusted sense. Adopting the concept of centrality from the sociology literature reveals that stocks with high centrality covary more with other stocks, suggesting greater analyst scrutiny. Classifying stocks into financial communities provides a novel way to look at risk-return trade-offs and to direct analyst attention, and offers new diversification insights for portfolio managers.</description><author>Das, S.

The yield spread of the average driveby deal widens versus the high-yield index in the first week and the first four weeks after issuance, while the spread of the average non-drive-by deal tightens.

Tracking error in index fund performance is unavoidable. It arises because the underlying index is measured as a paper portfolio, and it is assumed perfect replication can be achieved instantaneously and without cost. Tracking error has two components: exogenous tracking error (the result of index rules and maintenance procedures applied to the underlying index) and endogenous tracking error (the result of the individual activities of index managers managing open-end passive funds). An examination of a sample of S&amp;P 500 index mutual funds upon changes to the Index Divisor identifies a number of exogenous factors that are important determinants of tracking error for S&amp;P 500 index funds.</description><author>Frino, A.; Gallagher, D.

The default rate registered a record 12.8%, based on $757 billion outstanding.

An empirical study examines the consistency of rewards for bearing various types of risks in U. S. asset markets between 1985 and early 2002. Bearing duration risk and equity market risk was amply rewarded, while bearing long-dated credit risk-buying credit-risky bonds versus governments-realized puny average profits. Bearing short-dated credit risk gave the most consistent profits of all static overweight strategies, with an information ratio near one. Wide break-even spread cushions may be one explanation for the superior reward for risk at short maturities.

Risk budgeting interpreted as efficient portfolio allocation is often based on expected outperformance, alpha or information ratio. Once this crucial input has been estimated, it is frequently treated as fully reliable. One can use historical measures to develop some sense, both theoretical and practical, of the extent of the uncertainty and use a model to characterize the uncertainty of the expected active returns. Examples demonstrate the potential impact of uncertain parameters.

Active portfolio managers often see themselves as assemblers of efficient portfolios that maximize information ratios through the value-added of their proprietary investment insights (alphas), but approaches to reconciling often-contradicting investment insights differ widely. A linear combination of different investment insights can be used to support an analytical framework that maximizes the information from one single source. Simulations based on this framework reveal the impact of varying two key variables-the cross-sectional correlation of alpha signals and the time series correlations of the information coefficients related to alpha signals. The latter plays a more important role, providing diversification benefit to strategy risk over time. This analytical foundation has applications in sensitivity analysis and improving active performance.</description><author>Sorensen, E.

The evolution of quantitative methods in finance is changing the investment management industry. With an altered focus in finance and investment theory, theoretical concepts such as market efficiency and market equilibrium have ceded ground to econometric methods that allow a more pragmatic investigation of asset predictability. Mean-variance optimization, one of the cornerstones of classic finance theory, presents some problems in practice, and recent developments in Bayesian modeling and robust optimization techniques circumvent some of its weaknesses. Beyond the classic framework, we must model the feedback mechanisms that we know to operate in financial markets, with caution as to model risk, data snooping, and overfitting biases.</description><author>Focardi, S.

Similarly, investors want more than the utilitarian benefits of low risk and high expected returns when they choose investments; they want additional utilitarian benefits, and they want expressive benefits as well.

When they want to see how complex systems work, scientists often turn to asynchronous-time simulation models, in which processes change sporadically, typically at irregular intervals, over time. Such models are rarely used in finance now, but they may prove valuable tools for understanding how markets respond to changes in the participation rates of different types of investors, for example, or to changes in regulatory or investment policies. The authors describe asynchronous simulation generally, and illustrate its capabilities in terms of an asynchronous, discrete-event stock market simulator that they developed. The JLM Market Simulator allows its users to create a model of the market, using their own inputs. JLM Sim users can vary the number of investors, traders, portfolio analysts, statisticians, and securities, as well as the decisions rules used in investing and trading. Compared with most models used today, such a simulation may be able to provide a more realistic picture of complex markets.</description><author>Jacobs, B. I.; Levy, K. N.; Markowitz, H.

G.
Academic studies suggest stock market prices are to a considerable extent predictable. Investors tend to earn higher returns when the market sells at relatively low price-earnings multiples and high dividend yields. Value stocks supposedly outperform growth stocks, and smaller companies produce higher returns than larger firms. Moreover, buying losers over the past several years supposedly trumps a strategy of buying recent winners. In fact, investment strategies undertaken with real money cannot make the excess returns that academic studies suggest. Market-timing strategies based on initial valuation metrics do not outperform a buy-and-hold strategy. Value stock, small-cap, and contrarian managers do not consistently outperform the market. The strongest statistical pattern we find among actual money managers is that returns are enhanced by low expenses and low turnover.</description><author>Malkiel, B.

Gains of the. 1980s and 1990s in stocks and bonds arose from a bull market in capitalism and falling inflation, conditions that do not appear on today's horizon. Instead, the years ahead promise to be marked by a bull market in government and the-end of a 20-year period of disinflation. In this environment, monetary policy will assume different aims and employ different strategies. Adjustment to the prospective weights between public and private sector in the mixed economy of the U.S., as well as to a new monetary policy regime, will be an essential requirement for investment success in-this Brave New World.</description><author>McCulley, P.</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Sep 2004 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Blinded by theory?</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Arnott, R.

Theories are but theories; they help us understand how the world should work. There's no harm in raising arguments that suggest the world works somewhat differently from the theory, but often the investment community accepts theories and their underlying assumptions as fact. All too often, we prefer to operate on the basis of heuristics or shortcuts, some shaped by theory and others by convention, rather than examine our core assumptions; these heuristics can set the stage for error on a massive scale. We forecast the future by extrapolating the past, and assume that retained earnings will be reinvested more wisely than if shareholders received this cash in dividends to fuel future growth. Investors and academicians too rarely test their hypotheses, or they accept the data if they contradict the theories.</description><author>Arnott, R.

The twin decades of 1980-1999 provided annual returns to the U.S. equity market in the high double digits, but moving forward over the next decade, returns are expected to be in the mid- to high single digits, just when corporate and public pension plans face both a growing retiree population and lengthening average retiree longevity. To meet these challenges, pension plans must think beyond their benchmarks, and remove the restrictions associated with strategic asset allocation models. Traditional-asset allocation models partition the financial markets into neat benchmark boxes, perhaps useful for planning purposes but surely inhibitive for alpha extraction and return maximization.</description><author>Anson, M.</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Sep 2004 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>An alternative future</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Asness, C.
Hedge funds are supposed to make money all the. time, and when they fail at this, their investors redeem and go to someone else who has recently been making money. Every three or four years they deliver a one in a hundred-year flood. They are generally unregulated and generally do not tell us what they do. Yet inflows to hedge funds from institutions and others have been off the charts for the last few years. Despite some definite dark sides to the industry that need to be recognized and then ameliorated, hedge funds are central to the future of investment management.

While almost all institutional investment funds take active risk, the amount is almost uniformly a tiny fraction of the market risk that they expose themselves to. Readily available financial engineering techniques today allow funds to separate market risk from active risk. Given the lack of correlation between the two, the optimal allocation to active risk is very sensitive to the net aggregate information ratio from active management. It makes no sense that this assumption should be virtually the same, around 0.04, for all funds. Some funds will focus on indexing to reduce costs. Others will seek to increase the amount and improve the quality of their active risk. If these developing trends continue, look for interesting implications for the asset management industry.</description><author>Litterman, R.</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Sep 2004 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Investing contingent capital</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Layard-Liesching, R.
Passive investment of capital will not serve to meet return goals for many pension funds, a reality that is fueling huge interest in new alpha activities. Alpha strategies appear to offer incremental return with the same capital invested, but an alpha strategy can add value only because fund capital is at risk, so alpha return, should be measured relative to the contingent capital placed at risk in order to obtain the return. This contingent capital framework can also be used to evaluate new alternatives such as insurance or credit derivatives. Based on extreme value theory, it provides an improved framework for efficient use of the fund's total risk budget.</description><author>Layard-Liesching, R.</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Sep 2004 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Reengineering investment management</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Kritzman, M.; Thomas, L. R.
The conventional approach to building portfolios of investments is inefficient.. Our usual hierarchy of investment decisions imposes constraints on active management that are under most circumstances unnecessary and produce mean-variance-inefficient portfolios. An approach to portfolio design based on the concept of alpha portability eliminates these harmful constraints; an analogous idea is beta portability. Numerical examples reveal that alpha independence and separation are necessary but insufficient conditions for mean-variance efficiency. These features must be combined with leverage to effect portability and achieve the best expected outcome.</description><author>Kritzman, M.; Thomas, L.

R.; Siegel, L. B.
Three interrelated issues in international investing are explored here. First, despite (or because of) years of underperformance, international equity investment strategies are very much worth pursuing. Second, high levels of active risk are not necessarily a winning strategy in international equities; an aversion to active risk is just as rational in international markets as it is domestically. Finally, when investment decisions that are naturally separate are in fact separated, the efficient frontier moves up and to the left-portfolio efficiency improves-because we use more of the information collected by the analyst. Thus, in international portfolios, the investment manager should make security, country, and currency decisions independently of one another, and arguably admit short as well as long positions.</description><author>Olma, A.

History tells us that global capital markets can contract as well as expand-and a long-term view of finance suggests investors should prepare for periodic segmentation as well as integration of markets in the 21st century. Anti-capitalist ideologies have historically been the vectors of attack on the cross-border flow of capital, when the fundamental cause may really be domestic hostility toward foreign ownership and control, and the roots of the conflict between domestic interests and foreign investors may be inherent in global equilibrium models. In a frictionless capital market, foreigners will always own a higher proportion of a small economy's assets. By the same token, domestic investors in small economies will always seek to export most of their capital. This equilibrium is at odds with a stable condition of national ownership and control of assets.</description><author>Goetzmann, W.

Each passing decade of new Wall Street experience, the statistical record shows, confirms rather than denies the verdict that few investors can beat the market. Yes, most investors and their advisors are irrationally inefficient, but this in no way guarantees investors can thereby profit from a micro-inefficient market. Economic history confirms that markets are much more macro-inefficient than they are micro-inefficient. Neither Wall Street nor its clients understand nuances of the time-horizon problem. And, if (when?) lobbyist-driven politics let us manage some of our own Social Security funds, the odds are a hundred-to-one that the retirement nest eggs we achieve will fall materially below what broad inexpensive indexing could deliver in terms of diversified risk-corrected total returns.</description><author>Samuelson, P.

W.
One of the most influential ideas in the past 30 years is the efficient markets hypothesis, the idea that market prices incorporate all information rationally and instantaneously. The emerging discipline of behavioral economics and finance has challenged the EMH, arguing that markets are not rational, but rather driven by fear and greed. Research in the cognitive neurosciences suggests these two perspectives are opposite sides of the same coin. An adaptive markets hypothesis that reconciles market efficiency with behavioral alternatives applies the principles of evolution-competition, adaptation, and natural selection-to financial interactions. Extending Simon's notion of "satisficing" with evolutionary dynamics, the author argues that much of what behaviorists cite as counter-examples to economic rationality-loss aversion, overconfidence, overreaction, mental accounting, and other behavioral biases-is in fact consistent with an evolutionary model of individual adaptation to a changing environment via simple heuristics. The adaptive markets hypothesis offers a number of surprisingly concrete implications for portfolio management.</description><author>Lo, A.

if investors are rational, firms and fund managers should not worry about the degree of their leverage or investment in the riskless asset-investors can always increase or reduce leverage by borrowing or lending themselves, thus creating their own so-called homemade leverage. The CAPM, the Sharpe ratio, and the Modigliani-Miller theory of capital structure rely on this idea. But are investors capable of effectively employing homemade leverage in their decision-making? When financial practitioners and management students are asked to choose one of several funds that they can mix with a risk-free asset, almost half of them fail to integrate the cash flows from the risky asset and the risk-free asset-and thus choose very inefficient portfolios. When they can choose from mixed funds, which perform the cash flow integration for the subjects, efficient choices are made 98% of the time. Clearly fund managers should carefully consider their funds' leverage; capital structure may influence firm values by virtue of a clientele effect.</description><author>Levy, H.; Levy, M.; Alisof, N.</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2004 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>The style drift score - A quantitative measure.</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Idzorek, T.

Tracking error is not necessarily bad. Good tracking error would be outperformance of a portfolio with respect. to the benchmark. If they severely restrict the amounts invested in active strategies as a result of tight tracking error constraints, investors foreclose the opportunity for significant outperformance, especially during market downturns. A new methodology based on an optimal dynamic adjustment of the fractions invested in a passive core versus an active satellite portfolio allows investors to gain full access to good tracking error, while keeping bad tracking error below a given threshold.

The long-only constraint imposed in traditional portfolios is one of the more severe constraints in terms of its impact on potential value-added, particularly for portfolios benchmarked to a capitalization-weighted benchmark such as the SP 500; it can reduce the effectiveness of the manager's information by 50% or more. This loss can be avoided to a great degree by eliminating the long-only constraint or by creating a market-neutral portfolio with a derivatives overlay to restore market exposure. The information ratio can also be increased considerably using only underlying securities by allowing modest short positions and using the cash generated to purchase an equivalent amount of long positions, thus maintaining full market exposure.</description><author>Clarke, R.

Dynamic leverage as defined here depends on the level of hedge fund volatility, time horizon, and the difference between the fund's net asset value and its critical liquidation level. The critical liquidation level is the level of net asset value loss from which the fund manager could not recover and the fund would need to be liquidated to meet margin calls and redemptions. Dynamic leverage may be formalized very generally as a barrier option. At some intermediate critical level (above the liquidation level), efforts to reduce risk have little influence on the chance the fund will hit the critical liquidation level. A constant dynamic leverage portfolio insurance modifies the more traditional classic portfolio insurance.</description><author>De Souza, C.; Smirnov, M.</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2004 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>An alternative future: Part II - An exploration of the role of hedge funds.</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Asness, C.

It is widely known that stocks added to the S&amp;P 500 index experience abnormal returns on announcement. Why then do S&amp;P 500 indexers not trade at the opening price immediately following announcement of a change in the index, which would gain them an average of 19.2 additional basis points of return per year? The catch is a much higher standard deviation of tracking error. To achieve the low tracking errors observed in practice, an indexer must closely follow an exact-replication strategy. That two of the largest indexers have enhanced their returns indicates more active management than just holding all 500 stocks in the exact same proportions as the index. Practitioners interviewed suggest - and the empirical evidence confirms - that many indexers are effectively compensated for entering into bilateral agreements with providers of liquidity to trade at the closing price. The patterns of abnormal returns for changes in the index are exactly those that are needed to compensate liquidity providers for the risks that they assume in providing liquidity to indexers.</description><author>Blume, M.

Active investment managers provide two types of return: the return from market exposure (or beta) and the return from selection skill (or alpha). Active beta returns typically come from market timing - increasing market exposure in up markets and reducing it in down markets; passive beta returns come from index fund exposure. Alpha comes from security selection within an asset class, so the value that stock-picking adds does not depend on the direction of the market. A true stock-picker, that is, would have a beta of 1.0 relative to the market benchmark, and all value-added would come from active risk or stock-picking. "Portable" alpha may be achieved by separating the alpha from the beta and then applying it to other portfolios. Investors can obtain portable alphas through traditional long-only strategies. There are benefits and drawbacks of implementing portable alphas in a variety of investment scenarios.</description><author>Kung, E.; Pohlman, L.</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2004 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Investing in global equities - Changing determinants of returns.</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Cavaglia, S.; Diermeier, J.; Moroz, V.; De Zordo, S.
Accelerating globalization of business enterprise and the integration of capital markets are altering the international equity investment environment. The empirical evidence suggests that security price returns have become more closely associated with industry affiliation than with country of domicile. Within-country comparisons of securities are now a less effective way to identify attractively valued stocks; comparing securities within global industries and across countries appears instead to provide a more powerful approach to identifying future winners. Structural changes like these necessitate a more global approach to equity investing. Plan sponsors, asset managers, and individual investors should respond by altering their investment process to reflect this new economic reality.</description><author>Cavaglia, S.; Diermeier, J.; Moroz, V.; De Zordo, S.</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2004 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Sell discipline and institutional money management - Depends greatly on market conditions.</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Faugere, C.; Shawky, H.

There has been next to no study in the financial literature of sell decisions. An institutional money management database covering more than 7,000 investment portfolios now facilitates examination of different sell discipline criteria with respect to risk-adjusted returns and downside risk. The evidence indicates that portfolio performance is strongly related to the choice of the sell discipline criterion, even correcting for the potential effects of investment style changes over the period investigated. In rising markets, institutional money managers are likely to benefit from using less restrictive sell discipline criteria, while in declining markets they might benefit from a more restrictive sell discipline criterion. Market conditions, that is, strongly influence the effectiveness of the various sell discipline criteria.</description><author>Faugere, C.; Shawky, H. A.; Smith, D.

Our ability today to construct a great number of portfolios that all satisfy the same set of static collateralized debt obligation (CDO) investment guideline, can potentially introduce credit hot spots that will not be detected by traditional rating agency measures. As more and more CDO market participants recognize these risks, they are turning to market-based measures such as bond and loan prices and debt-equity models to parse credit aberrations in credit portfolios and detect selection biases. Various market-based information and models will be helpful in CDO and cash-based portfolio selection. New asset selection tools for structured credit products allow investors to benchmark the performance of seasoned CDO tranches.</description><author>McDermott, G.; Skarabot, J.; Kroujiline, A.</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2004 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>A value at risk approach to risk-return analysis: Comment</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Huang, X.

B.
The notion of duration-matching, well-developed in the 1980s in nominal terms, is here extended to the dual durations of price sensitivity to real interest rates and to inflation rates. All assets (and liabilities) can be characterized more accurately using two durations instead of one. Equities and many other assets and instruments have different real interest rate and inflation durations, as does a liability. Duration-matching offers a secondary pension risk control measure after surplus optimization. The author develops a solution that duration-matches assets with the pension liability, and shows how to integrate it with surplus optimization, achieving better pension risk control in the process.</description><author>Waring, M.

A structured global optimization model budgets a fund's total active risk (tracking error) among its asset classes or across investment managers. Its objective is to maximize total fund expected excess return (over benchmark) for a given level of total fund tracking error (the active risk budget), assuming that total fund and asset class tracking errors are controlled solely through the selection of investment managers with various active risk profiles. The key innovations are, first, that the efficient frontier (expected excess return versus tracking error) of each asset class is fitted to a functional form, and then the optimal active risk level for each asset class is determined using the asset class efficient frontier functions as inputs. The model compares well to a structured global linear model and an unstructured global model that optimizes with respect to A investment managers simultaneously.</description><author>Figelman, I.</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2004 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Index fundamentalism revisited - The majesty of simplicity?</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Reinker, K.

Analysis of synthetic portfolios based on the assets of Vanguard's mutual funds indicates that whether index funds or managed funds are the superior buy depends on the time span in question, but managed funds almost always have a lower standard deviation of return than index funds.</description><author>Reinker, K.

A shift in equity management would define the style of a company in terms of its fundamental ability to create wealth. From an economic value added perspective, a growth company invests for rapid economic profit change, while a value company looks to create wealth through downsizing or restructuring a low-to-negative economic profit spread business. In either case-EVA growth or value-these company types (among profiles between the extremes) represent good stocks when actual expectations of economic profit growth exceed expectations already imbedded in share price. This economic profit style of investing emphasizes the fundamentals of wealth creation and reconciliation of share price with the level realistically achievable.</description><author>Abate, J.

D.
The trade-offs between risk and return are different for buy-and-hold investors and total return investors. For buy-and-hold investors, the portfolio return distribution is asymmetric; the maximum return is the yield, and the maximum loss is represented by default. The standard tools that total return investors use for top-down asset allocation (such as mean-variance optimization) and bottom-up security selection (such as multifactor risk models) are thus inappropriate. A more suitable approach for buy-and-hold investors, given current spreads, default rates and correlations, and loss tolerance, derives an optimal macro allocation across credit qualities. Application of this approach yields an optimized portfolio to minimize expected shortfall due to defaults, subject to a spread target and other portfolio constraints. The results suggest buy-and-hold investors should first determine their allocations to the A and Baa sectors, and then use an optimizer to select individual names.</description><author>Dynkin, L.; Hyman, J.; Phelps, B.

It is an innovation to evaluate the three variables jointly. Such a combined analysis reveals that long-term security returns are strongly related to shifts in Fed monetary policy but generally invariant to changes in the political landscape.

yThe central message of this article is that no one should use the sample covariance matrix for portfolio optimization. It is subject to estimation error of the kind most likely to perturb a mean-variance optimizer. Instead, a matrix can be obtained from the sample covariance matrix through a transformation called shrinkage. This tends to pull the most extreme coefficients toward more central values, systematically reducing estimation error when it matters most. Statistically, the challenge is to know the optimal shrinkage intensity. Shrinkage reduces portfolio tracking error relative to a benchmark index, and substantially raises the manager's realized information ratio.</description><author>Ledoit, O.; Wolf, M.</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2004 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Measuring credit spread risk - Incorporating the tails.</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Campbell, R.; Huisman, R.
It is widely known that the possibility of default makes the expected return distribution for financial products that are subject to credit risk highly skewed and fat-tailed. Recent development of an unbiased tail index estimator enables modeling of the additional risk presented by changes in swap spreads. Tests on data from the U. S., the U. K., Germany, and Japan indicate that we tend to grossly underestimate the risk of large spread widenings and tightenings. Estimation of swap spread risk is dramatically improved when the severity of the additional downside risk is measured and incorporated into current estimation techniques. These results are crucial in improving credit risk management and pricing out-of-the-money credit derivatives.</description><author>Campbell, R.; Huisman, R.</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2003 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Stocks, bonds, and hedge funds - Not a free lunch.</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Amin, G.

What are the diversification effects of introducing hedge funds into a portfolio of stocks and bonds? In terms of skewness and kurtosis, equity and hedge funds do not combine very well. Although hedge funds significantly improve a portfolio's mean-variance characteristics, their inclusion can also be expected to lead to significantly lower skewness as well as higher kurtosis. Hedge funds do not provide a free lunch, but rather entail a definite trade-off between profit and loss potential. To have any impact on the overall portfolio, allocations to hedge funds would have to far exceed the typical 1% to 5% that many institutions typically consider.</description><author>Amin, G.

Hedge funds are supposed to be largely market-neutral, meaning their returns exhibit relatively little correlation with market returns. One often hears that they make money in down markets as well as up. To the extent that hedge fund returns are uncorrelated with market returns, and the funds earn a positive risk premium, a hedge fund allocation would be generally indicated for efficiently diversified portfolios. In fact, the evidence is that diversified hedge fund investment is not market-neutral; significant, persistent market exposures and a high degree of market correlation are identified here. Diversified hedge fund portfolios also exhibit a surprising degree of variability in factor exposures over time, revealing the limits of hedge fund style diversification and indicating a herding tendency. Hedge funds have not demonstrated the ability to make money in a down market, but rather a good sense of market timing in coping with the U. S. stock market bubble. Neither performance nor cost considerations warrant hedge fund inclusion in balanced portfolios.</description><author>Ennis, R. M.; Sebastian, M.

Developed here is a value at risk-based measure of portfolio performance called the reward-to-VaR ratio.

Under non-normality, the reward-to-VaR ratio at one confidence level may give a ranking for portfolio performance different from the ranking obtained at a different confidence level.

The common practice of classifying stocks as either value or growth on the basis of low or high price-to-book (PB) ratios - or, in general, any classification based on a criterion that includes current stock price - is equivocal. The practice is prone to confuse certain structural characteristics of stocks or firms with what are purely time influences. The PB of a firm may be structurally high (high on average over a long period of time), or high only momentarily (as a result of an exceptional price jump), so it would be a growth stock in the first case but not in the second. It would not be clear whether it is the structural characteristics of a stock or the time influences that are responsible for its performance. An experiment using an alternative definition of value and growth that deliberately separates the structural component from the time effects in PB ratios in six major markets demonstrates that, as soon as the time effects are eliminated in the classification process, value no longer outperforms.</description><author>Bourguignon, F.; de Jong, M.</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2003 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>On the nature of trading - Do speculators leave footprints?</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Silber, W.

Two types of traders, market makers and speculators, establish their positions and manage their risk exposure differently, but balance sheets are insufficient to let us determine whether a trader is a market maker or a speculator. We want to understand and verify trader behavior, because leveraged trading firms, and individual traders, typically have incentives to mask their risk-taking activities. Without proper monitoring, traders can substitute risky speculation for less risky market-making to reap potential payoffs. Trading records that describe the evolution of a position over time can help us identify the trading strategy pursued.

Research has proven the optimality of a no-trade region around an investor's desired asset proportions to assure that trading occurs only when asset proportions drift outside this region, and then only to bring proportions back to the boundary of the no-trade region, not to the target proportions. Because current solution methods are complex, managers typically rely on ad hoc heuristics that are either calendar-based or volatility-based and whose performance against an optimal strategy is unknown. The authors characterize the size and shape of the no-trade region as a function of key problem parameters and compare the performance of different rebalancing strategies.

Investors often increase their cash and near-cash balances during periods of significant equity volatility. Feeling compelled to salvage what they can in the face of adversity, these investors overlook the opportunity to enhance performance by extending duration in the fixed-income portion of their balanced portfolios. They neglect to keep strategic as well as tactical goals in mind. When equities dominate portfolio volatility, the risk profile of the overall portfolio is relatively insensitive to measured duration extensions. Conversely, the portfolio receives the full return benefit of such an extension. The decoupling of liquid Treasury returns from equity returns during periods of crisis can reinforce the beneficial trade-off of extending duration and slightly reducing equity exposure. An analysis of market data over the past 21 years not only documents the risk-adjusted return benefits of extending duration, but also suggests enhanced downside risk protection.</description><author>Harper, R.

Which investment choice is most important? Is it allocation among broad asset classes, country allocation, choice of sector, or selection of individual securities? Many investors have a false impression of the relative importance of these choices for two reasons. First, investors fail to distinguish between the activities they choose to emphasize and those with the greatest potential to influence investment results. Second, to the extent that investors do measure the potential influence of an investment activity, they often base their choices on contrived portfolios that are unobtainable. Simulations including thousands of realistic portfolios help us determine the natural dispersion of performance arising from different investment activities, which makes it possible to evaluate the hierarchy of investment choice from a normative perspective.</description><author>Kritzman, M.; Page, S.</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2003 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>The design and production of new retirement savings products: A comment - The possible cost of peace of mind.</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Dert, C.; Lodewijk, M.; Oldenkamp, B.; de Pooter, M.

How can the same hedge fund report different performance measures in different places? The answer is that auditing plays an important role in explaining the differences. Although the majority of hedge funds state that they have auditors, a significant proportion of these funds are not effectively audited. Funds that have gone out of business have been particularly less effectively audited than funds that have survived, and audited funds have much smaller return discrepancies than non-audited funds. There is a significantly positive correlation between the fund size and the auditing variable. Large funds tend to be audited and small fund not. Funds listed on exchanges, funds of funds, funds with broad investor representation, funds open to the public, funds invested in a single industrial sector, and unlevered funds have smaller return discrepancies than other funds. These findings suggest a compelling need for hedge fund auditing.</description><author>Liang, B.</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2003 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Appropriate policy allocation for alternative investments - A factor approach and simulation techniques.</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Terhaar, K.; Staub, R.; Singer, B.
One of the greatest problems institutional investors face in evaluating alternative investments such as venture capital, real estate, and hedge funds is determining the normal or policy allocation. The typical approach relies on single-period optimization programs, using historical data as key inputs. This is subject to problems such as enormous allocations to private equity and other non-market-priced investments. Instead, the authors use a factor approach to build a consistent set of return and risk characteristics for conventional and alternative asset classes alike. Simulation techniques rather than optimization provide better insight into the characteristics of the portfolio over time as market swings and liquidity constraints force divergence from the desired policy mix.</description><author>Terhaar, K.; Staub, R.; Singer, B.</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2003 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Why we all held our breath when the market reopened - The distinction between risk and uncertainty.</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Findlay, M.

The distinction that Knight and Keynes made between risk and uncertainty has been all but eliminated from the mainstream finance literature over the past 35 years. Along with construction of the joint hypothesis of efficiency and equilibrium, this has resulted in a generally accepted theory of financial markets where risk is made benign ( i. e., a mildly perturbed certainty) in order to achieve analytical tractability, and where acceptance of the neoclassical model is a test of faith. In fact, the authors argue this theory is a massive edifice built on a pile of authors argue, this theory is a massive edifice built on a pile of assumptions, presumptions, and ignored evidence, whose practical results range from the LTCM collapse to the dot-com bubble to Enron.</description><author>Findlay, M.

According to the efficient markets hypothesis, market returns are unpredictable and random around long-term market norms. In a perfectly efficient market, historical returns offer no useful insight into the formation of future return expectations. Behavioral finance theory suggests otherwise. Even if nobody can predict when the market will take a severe drop (such as down 20%), the overreaction hypothesis suggest that forward-looking returns will be above average after severe market drops. Market evidence presented here shows that severe downturns in the overall market are consistently followed by superior returns during the 12 months following. When investors overreact by giving extreme weight to recent negative returns, they run the risk of missing subsequent above-average rates of return.

The authors split equity investors into two groups, one of "smart money" institutional investors and the other of individual investors. Using quarterly data, they examine how aggregate ownership flows between the two groups are related to stock returns. Except in one case, increase in institutional ownership are associated with positive returns, and reductions in institutional ownership with negative returns, and the positive relationship between institutional ownership flows and returns is not explained by within-quarter momentum trading. These findings are consistent with the belief that institutional investors play a price-setting leadership role in the equity markets. The exception to the positive association between institutional ownership flows and returns is for small capitalization stocks; increases in institutional ownership of small capitalization stocks that were prior losers are associated with negative returns ( concentrated in the fourth quarter). This different return pattern for small-capitalization stocks is interpreted as consistent with institution buying stocks at price discounts from individuals who are systematically selling to establish tax-deductible capital losses.</description><author>Gibson, S.; Safieddine, A.</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2003 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Harry Markowitz and the discretionary wealth hypothesis - A new focus and a relatively simple framework.</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Wilcox, J.
In his 1959 book, Portfolio Selection, Harry Markowitz showed how return mean and variance combine to determine the expected long-term growth rate of capital. But maximization of that growth rate seems to fit the risk preferences of only a narrow range of aggressive investors unconcerned about shortfalls. The growth rate goal may in fact be generalized to both conservative and aggressive investors by mapping the distribution of returns on total wealth to returns on discretionary wealth. The definition of risk may be broadened to include return skew and kurtosis when required, to fully encompass the concept of downside risk. The resulting change in frame of reference extends Markowitz's criterion to many practical investment decisions involving maximizing long-run wealth while controlling the probability of shortfalls along the way.</description><author>Wilcox, J.</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2003 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Rebalancing - Establishing a consistent framework.</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Masters, S. J.
While the power of rebalancing to improve returns and reduce risk is generally acknowledged, there is relatively little work focused on the best way to implement a rebalancing policy. Most rebalancing policies use arbitrary "one size fits all" rules, and the more sophisticated approaches that have been proposed involve complex calculations. The author's simpler methodology allows investors to tailor their rebalancing policies to their risk tolerance, the cost of rebalancing, and the risk characteristics of each asset class in the portfolio. This approach addresses not only when to rebalance, but also how far back to rebalance. The result is a set of easily implemented rules for adhering to a rebalancing discipline.</description><author>Masters, S.

B.; Siegel, L. B.
When one eliminates all the market factors that active managers deliver (and that are available almost for free through index funds), what remains is the pure alpha. The cost of seeking this alpha is that one is forced to take on active risk. The authors draw on these observations to argue that building portfolios of active managers is an optimization problem that may be solved separately from the asset mix optimization problem (because pure active risk is uncorrelated with policy risk). They suggest that portfolios constructed using this approach emphasize index and risk-controlled active funds, while giving lighter allocations to traditional active funds and almost none to highly concentrated funds. For investors who are allowed to sell short, market-neutral long-short funds also have a place in the optimal solution.</description><author>Waring, M. B.; Siegel, L.

Most methods for forecasting expected returns of stocks are based on earnings. As analysts have justifiably become somewhat wary of earning reports, they are increasingly interested in developing valuation models that are based on sources and uses of cash. There should be some way analyze financial statements to make the two approaches give identical results, since the underlying economics are the same. The author provides a convenient formula that states the return expected by an investor in terms of the cash flow/price ratio, some fraction of the growth rate, and changes in valuation (i. e., PE expansion or contraction). The fraction of growth that ends up in the shareholder's pocket will depend on the size of the company's fixed asset accounts, and whether growth is financed by equity sale or debt issuance.</description><author>Estep, P.

Business ethics has been much in the news since the bursting of the bubble in 2000 - but that ethics can have a direct bearing on corporate earnings and on valuation receives too little attention. Many observers draw comfort from the crackdown on fraudulent accounting, although dubious corporate accounting is but the tip of the iceberg. More benign ( or rather more legal) forms of aggressive accounting probably boost U. S corporate earnings by at least 20% even now. This means that valuation levels are higher than they seem by a like margin. A more subtle but pernicious impact of aggressive accounting affects the market indirectly if people don't trust the numbers, they may price assets to reflect both a risk premium, reflecting objective risks in the markets, and a credibility premium, reflecting lingering investor concerns about the merits of the data that form the basis for valuation.</description><author>Arnott, R.

The "Fed model" is a popular yardstick for judging whether the stock market is fairly valued. It compares the stock market's earnings yield to the long-term government bond yield, while more traditional methods evaluate stock market valuation without regard to the level of interest rates. The Fed model is theoretically flawed, as it compares a real number to a nominal number, ignoring the fact that over the long term nominal earnings generally move in tandem with inflation. The crucible for testing a valuation indicator is how well it forecasts long-term returns, and the Fed model fails this test-traditional methods ace it. Lack of predictive ability aside, investors have indeed historically required a higher stock market P/E when nominal interest rates have been lower. This does not imply that the Fed model is valid, rather only that investors have historically followed it, perhaps in error. The relationship of stock and bond market yields is more complicated than conceived by the Fed model, varying systematically with perceptions of long-term stock and bond market risk. Addition of risk to the Fed model solves the puzzle of why stocks outperformed bonds for the first half of the 20th century, but have underperformed bonds since.</description><author>Asness, C.</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2003 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Asset allocation in a lower stock-bond correlation environment - How lower correlation would impact investor decisions and welfare.</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Dopfel, F. E.
The correlation between stock and bond returns plays a critical role in asset allocation decisions and in the effectiveness of stock-bond diversification in reducing portfolio risk. During the last few years, the realized stock-bond correlation has trended lower than historical norms, and the current 36-month rolling estimate is significantly negative, while most analysts still assume a moderately positive equilibrium estimate for expected correlation. Many investors are now questioning their assumptions about correlation and whether lower correlation will continue. This decoupling of stock and bond returns combined with aggressive as set allocation strategies has contributed to deterioration in pension plan funded ratios, producing unfavorable impacts for investors with an economic liability. The various strategic and tactical asset allocation issues related to a continued low correlation environment have an impact on investor welfare in an asset-only and an asset-liability framework. For investors, low stock-bond correlation is beneficial in an asset-only context, but detrimental in the case of a bond-like liability, especially if there is significant underfunding of the liability.</description><author>Dopfel, F.

Many institutional investors use a barbell strategy to invest their large-cap equity portfolios. This strategy mixes passive managers (who have no tracking error) with traditional concentrated active managers (who usually have high tracking errors) to moderate the total portfolio's active risk. The authors believe investors can achieve better results by including in the mix low-tracking error structured managers (also known as enhanced-index or benchmark-sensitive managers). They call this approach the spectrum strategy, because it allocates risk across the entire active risk spectrum. The historical analysis shows structured managers have generally achieved higher risk-m adjusted returns (i.e., information ratios) than traditional managers. Their relative performance advantage is due to, first, structured managers' focus on risk management (i.e., less noise in the information ratio's denominator), and second, their relative freedom from the no-short constraint (i.e., the no-short constraint is less binding when managers target small active deviations). Perhaps surprisingly, given the expected information ratio advantage, allocations to structured managers should come primarily from the plan's passive allocation rather than from traditional active managers.</description><author>Alford, A.; Jones, P.; Winkelmann, K.</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2003 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Tactical asset allocation with pairwise strategies - Using pairwise information to influence weights.</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Qian, E.
An alternative approach to quantitative tactical asset allocation (TAA) is based on time series forecasting models and mean-variance optimization. The central concept is pairwise TAA, and the correct metric for assessing forecast quality is the pairwise information coefficient. TAA using mean-variance optimization is generally equivalent to a linear combination of pairwise TAA, with the relative weights of the pairs in the combination directly connected to the covariance matrix used in the optimization. TAA managers should avoid using a covariance matrix without knowing its implied pairwise weights, but instead should use pairwise information to influence the choice of the,pairwise weights. The expected long-term performance of TAA strategies for a given set of pair-wise weights as well as optimal sets of pairwise combinations that attain the maximum information ratio is-also derived.</description><author>Qian, E.</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2003 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Portfolio construction with qualitative forecasts - It doesn't need to be a black box.</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Herold, U.
The vast majority of active portfolio managers use a fundamental investment approach. They do not generate quantitative forecasts but instead express their market views in a qualitative manner. The portfolio construction approach in practice is usually purely ad hoc: overweighting assets with a bullish outlook by some prespecified amount, and underweighting assets for which the view is bearish. A structured approach for portfolio construction leads to a more consistent implementation of market views and to more balanced portfolios in terms of risk profile. This approach incorporates several diagnostic tools and a Bayesian model. It also allows a portfolio manager to compute the shrinkage in the information ratio when implementing a suboptimal portfolio. This mitigates the need for transactions and hence reduces transaction costs.</description><author>Herold, U.</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2003 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Practical risk analysis - For portfolio managers and traders.</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Madhavan, A.; Yang, J.

Investors and chief investment officers who are invested in (or bear responsibility for) many products face a resource allocation problem. Which products deserve their attention and scrutiny? Ideally investors will focus on products that appear to be in trouble, but these are not easily identified using the classic methods of performance evaluation. In fact, it is often claimed that it takes 40 years to determine whether an active portfolio outperforms its benchmark. The authors demonstrate that a statistical process control scheme known as the CUSUM can be used to detect flat-to-the-benchmark performance in 40 months, and to detect underperformance faster still. By rapidly detecting underperformance, the CUSUM allows investors and CIOs to focus their attention on potential problems before they have a serious impact on the performance of the overall portfolio. The CUSUM procedure is provably optimal; for any given rate of false alarms, no other procedure can detect underperformance as quickly. It is robust to the distribution of excess returns, allowing its use in almost any asset class without modification.</description><author>Philips, T. K.; Yashchin, E.; Stein, D.

With low government interest rates and increased correlation across sovereign markets in Europe and the United States, investors and money managers have been searching for new ways to increase the return of fixed-income portfolios. At the same time, bond markets outside the United States have seen significant growth in non-sovereign sectors like corporates and mortgages. In Europe this development is mainly a consequence of the introduction of a common currency. Global sovereign bond investors can now access credit sectors across markets to expand their investment universe. Single-currency investors, on the other hand, especially those domiciled in small and illiquid markets, profit from the wider global investment-grade markets through multimarket and multisector (global aggregate) portfolios, while hedging currency exposures. Money managers can thus add value to portfolios through a much wider investment opportunity set. Analysis of the advantages of global aggregate portfolios with respect to other types of fixed-income portfolios, especially on a currency-hedged basis, confirms the intuitive assessment that global aggregate portfolios offer a better risk-return trade-off than local or global sovereign portfolios. Money managers, while profiting from a wider opportunity set, have to balance this advantage against the increased complexity and number of strategy dimensions.</description><author>Jochum, C.; Pagani, G.</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2003 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Sovereign spreads and emerging market equity returns - Why variation in spreads is useful.</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Gendreau, B.; Heckman, L.
There is evidence that the information incorporated in sovereign spreads can be used to-improve country allocation strategies in emerging equity markets. Historically, sovereign spreads have been a value-oriented indicator of future equity performance a-cross countries. Wide spreads have tended to signal rising future equity returns, and vice versa. In the backtests reported, sovereign spreads are found to be useful in forecasting equity returns even taking into account measures of equity valuations, real interest rates, and country credit ratings. Divergence of spreads from recent trends also appears to convey information about future equity returns. Countries where spreads have been falling tend to outperform. This effect, however, is not as strong as the tendency of countries with wide spreads to perform well in the future.</description><author>Gendreau, B.; Heckman, L.</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2003 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Consumer confidence and stock returns - What sentiment tells us.</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Fisher, K.

In the beginning real estate was regarded as a diversifier, bolstered by the Employee Retirement Security Act of 1974. However, given real estate's nature as a debt-equity hybrid and the emergence of new ways to invest in real estate markets, it is clear that there could be additional motivations for choosing to include real estate in a mixed asset portfolio. This article explores 5 possible uses for real estate: to reduce overall portfolio risk, to achieve high absolute returns, to hedge unexpected inflation or deflation, to reflect the overall investment universe and/or to deliver strong cash flows to the investor. But first we must re-define real estate to encompass the new public debt and equity markets that have joined the traditional private debt and equity markets for real estate. A new index of overall real estate performance is presented. The article concludes by considering the types of investors who might see a role for real estate; several classes of investor would likely benefit from the inclusion of real estate in their investment portfolio.</description><author>Hudson-Wilson, S.; Fabozzi, F.

Real estate investment represents a significant part of many institutional portfolios. Since real estate is not directly traded on a centralized exchange, the physical real estate market is characterized by relative lack of liquidity, large lot size, and high transactions costs with properties that are fixed at a location and heterogeneous. The low transparency of the real estate marketplace also results in potential asymmetric information. This provides a source of relatively high risk-adjusted returns to those individuals who can obtain costless "quality" information. Furthermore, the lack of frequent transaction data for the analysis of return distributions often necessitates the use of appraisal-based series. In this article, the authors examine the benefits of real estate investments as part of an investor's overall asset portfolio.</description><author>Georgiev, G.; Gupta, B.; Kunkel, T.</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Sep 2003 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Firming property prices and weak cash flows - Rational and not a disconnect.</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Corcoran, P.

Firming property prices in recession and early recovery are consistent with investors expecting income weakness to be temporary. The authors argue that these expectations are supported by anticipated restraint in new construction, restraint that has been in place since the mid-1990s and contrasts sharply with overbuilding that characterized the 1980s. Firm property prices and weak cash flows in the economic downturn since 2001 have resulted in falling cap rates (gross property yields) according to the authors. This pattern represents a profound shift from undisciplined markets of 1980-1995, when cap rates generally declined in expansion (1983-1990) and rose sharply (1990-1995) in retrenching real estate markets.</description><author>Corcoran, P.

This article addresses empirically recent concerns about a dichotomy between capital markets and real estate market fundamentals. Motivated by recent decreases in capitalization (cap) rates in light of weak market fundamentals some analysts have argued that the latter no longer matter in real estate asset pricing. Some other analysts argue that these phenomena reflect a structural shift in the way investors' factor market fundamentals in their pricing decisions. Building on the findings of past empirical research, the authors emphasize that the true effect of market fundamentals can be analyzed and understood only after controlling for the effect of interest rates, which recently reached record-low levels. Empirical analysis of cap rate levels and spreads provides evidence of the strong effect of interest rates on cap rate levels, and systematic effects of market fundamentals on both cap rate levels and spreads that reveal a myopic (inefficient) view on the part of real estate investors. No statistically decent evidence is found to point to a weakening of the effect of market fundamentals or a shift towards a forward-looking (efficient) view of such fundamentals in the last two years.</description><author>Sivitanides, P.

Whenever interest rates fall and positive leverage conditions hold, the subject of the use of leverage in a portfolio of real estate inevitably comes up. When the cost of debt falls below the income yield on an asset or portfolio of assets, there is positive leverage and it can be used to raise the return on the asset(s). While using leverage seems trivial (how can positive leverage be a "bad" thing?), it is, in fact, quite complex and raises some philosophical and operational issues for the investor. In this article the authors discuss the many aspects of the leverage decision and offer a recommendation. Throughout the discussion they assume that leverage can be applied, creating a Positive spread, at least initially. They do not discuss the use of very aggressive leverage as an opportunistic strategy; leverage is considered only in the context of a base real estate portfolio strategy.</description><author>Anson, M.; Hudson-Wilson, S.</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Sep 2003 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>VaR: A tool to measure leverage risk - More accurate than the Sharpe ratio.</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Gordon, J.

When considering how much leverage to use with a real estate portfolio, a good risk measure is needed to evaluate the risk-reward trade-off. The Sharpe ratio, which is not very sensitive to changes in leverage, masks the very different risk/return combinations created by various levels of debt. The authors argue that Value at Risk (VaR) is a far better and more intuitive risk measure to use when making leverage decisions. VaR shows portfolio managers a concrete amount they stand to lose over a specified time horizon and within a pre-determined confidence interval. As such, it can be used.-to set an upper limit on the amount of risk that a portfolio manager is willing to take on when applying leverage. The authors explain that the VaR technique is particularly well suited to institutional real estate portfolios because it captures the full extent of risk for investors less willing to exercise the borrower's put-option and it incorporates information about correlations across property types and regional economies.</description><author>Gordon, J.

Despite ongoing political, economic, and financial uncertainties, the long-term trend of financial market "globalization" continues. This trend has been driven by equity and bond investments, but cross-border real estate investment has increased in recent years. Recent disaffection with stock performance means real estate is at the forefront of many investors' thinking and, increasingly, they are considering real estate as a global asset class. This article seeks to help measure and explain the relative risks of global real estate markets by providing a simple, objective measure of real estate risk based on three components: country, structural real estate, and cyclical real estate risks. Together these measures capture the key dimensions of risk and provide important insights for global real estate strategies. An investor's tolerance for various types of risk varies according to investment strategy. The authors conclude by showing how different combinations of types of risk provide different insights according to the perspective of the investor, whether they are "opportunistic," "core," or "debt focused."</description><author>Chen, J.; Hobbs, P.</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Sep 2003 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>The impact of structuring on CMBS class performance - Complex interactions between collateral and structure.</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Jacob, D.

The structure of a commercial mortgage-backed security-the combination of the characteristics of the underlying loans and the design of the cash flow algorithm that creates the bond classes-can affect the performance of the various bond classes. In a simple pass-through, the affects on the resulting bonds are fairly straightforward. Any resulting complications are a function of the lack of homogeneity of the characteristics of the underlying loans. More typical senior/subordinated multi-class structures with several interest-only bond classes often lead to some less-than-intuitive performance results for the bonds, especially when combined with heterogeneous collateral. In this article, the authors explain the impact of structuring on the bond classes of a CMBS structure. They explain why while there are some similarities between the structuring of commercial and residential mortgage pools, the differences in the features of the underlying loans lead to different considerations in creating commercial versus residential mortgage-backed securities.</description><author>Jacob, D.

This article presents empirical evidence of credit migrations of commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS). The findings support anecdotal accounts that adverse credit migrations; have been highly concentrated in CMBS from single-borrower lease-backed deals from 1993 and 1994. Favorable credit migrations, in contrast, are much more evenly distributed across the CMBS universe. CMBS rated by multiple rating agencies are less likely to suffer adverse credit migrations.

L.; Scherer, K. A.; Monopoli, R. T.
Comparisons of the performance of public and private real estate equities are provided in this article. In so doing, the authors control for three of the main differences between these investment alternatives: property-type mix, leverage and appraisal smoothing. They then ran tests to determine in a statistical sense whether the restated means and volatilities of the two series were in fact different from one another. The clear answer is that they were not, suggesting a fairly seamless real estate market in which public- and private-market vehicles display a long-run synchronicity. This has two important implications for portfolio management. First, public- and private-market vehicles ought to be viewed as (somewhat interchangeably) offering investors a risk/return continuum of real estate investment opportunities. Second, while the "platform" did not matter in terms of observed return characteristics, the platform may matter with regard to liquidity, governance, transparency, control, executive compensation, and so on, an apparent clientele effect hints that these issues may be valued differently by large and small investors.</description><author>Pagliari, J.

E.
In this article the author examines the constant and variable liquidity direct real estate price indexes developed by Fisher, Gatzlaff, Geltner, and Haurin and uses them in asset allocation exercises. Review of these indexes suggests they provide improved measures of direct real estate performance that do much to remedy problems resulting from the appraisal-induced smoothing of the NCREIF property index. Optimization results based on the period from 1987 to 2001 indicate that significant overweighting of both direct and securitized real estate was appropriate and that direct and securitized real estate were complementary investments. These results and related considerations suggest that real estate should receive at least a neutral weighting in contemporary institutional portfolios.</description><author>Feldman, B.

Several approaches to assessing the volatility of private market or direct real estate as an asset class are illustrated in this article. These approaches yield reasonably consistent estimates, falling in a range of 6.5%-9.0% annualized standard deviation of total return for a diversified portfolio of unleveraged, core properties. The estimates take into account the lack of statistical independence from quarter to quarter that is characteristic of private market real estate returns. The estimates provide useful guidance for quantifying the risk of direct real estate for purposes of evaluating real estate's potential role in a multi-asset class portfolio. In addition, the empirical estimates have intuitive appeal: they lie between investment-grade bonds and large-cap stocks.</description><author>Giliberto, M.</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Sep 2003 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Property, common stock, and property shares - Increased potential for diversification.</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Brounen, D.; Eichholtz, P.
In this article the authors examine the relationship between private property, the securitized property share market, and the common stock market in the United States and the United Kingdom during the period 1986 to 2002. They find that the correlations between property share returns and common stock returns are show a similar decreasing trend for both countries, indicating increased mixed-asset diversification potential for property shares. After applying standard unsmoothing and hedging techniques, in order to abstract from the underlying market structures, the authors discover increased similarities between the securitized and unsecuritized property performances in both countries. Combining the performance characteristics of both property investment vehicles results in new insights regarding the position of real estate in mixed-asset portfolios.</description><author>Brounen, D.; Eichholtz, P.</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Sep 2003 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>IRR-Based property-level performance attribution - Helping to evaluate management skill.</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Geltner, D.
In this article, the author reviews the concept and practice of property level investment performance attribution. A new approach for performance attribution based on the property level since-acquisition internal rate of return (IRR) is presented, including numerical examples and usage recommendations. A methodology is presented for parsing the IRR into three components: Initial Yield, Cash Flow Change, and Yield Change; and for bench-marking performance in these attributes against NCREIF properties. The relationship is discussed between the three IRR attributes and the four fundamental property level investment management functions of. Property Selection, Acquisition Transaction Execution, Operational Management, and Disposition Transaction Execution. Resulting information and insights should be useful for entities managing large portfolios of real properties, including pension fund advisors and REITs.</description><author>Geltner, D.</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Sep 2003 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Expected returns on stocks and bonds - Investors must moderate their expectations.</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Ilmanen, A.
There is an ongoing shift in opinion about expected asset returns. Ex antE equity returns are less transparent and thus more open to question than ex ante bond returns. Long-term equity returns have traditionally been predicted from historical average market returns, but today they are increasingly predicted using dividend discount models. Realized average returns are misleading guides for the future when expected returns vary over time, and our recent bear market has made investors more aware of forward-looking expected return measures; the starting price matters. Neither of two types of "expected returns"-objectively feasible long-run returns and subjective (often hoped-for, extrapolative) return expectations-can be directly observed, but we can try to estimate them by analyzing historical returns, investor surveys, and market valuation indicators. Objectively feasible equity returns have been low for several years (5%-8%), but subjective return expectations have begun to moderate only recently. The divergence between objective and hoped-for returns was extraordinarily wide around 2000; while the gap has narrowed since, it may not have fully closed.</description><author>Ilmanen, A.</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2003 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Estimating the stock/bond risk premium - An alternative approach.</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Hunt, L.

A multiperiod portfolio model provides significant advantages over traditional single-period approaches-especially for long-term investors. Such a framework can enhance risk-adjusted performance and help investors evaluate the probability of reaching financial goals by linking asset and liability policies. Multiperiod portfolio models consist of three basic components: a stochastic scenario generator; a policy rule simulator; and an optimization module that identifies non-dominated solutions. Useful applications are in pension planning, insurance risk management, hedge funds, and asset allocation for individual investors.</description><author>Mulvey, J. M.; Pauling, W. R.; Madey, R.

E.
As the investment management industry becomes more sophisticated, investment managers have come to use benchmark indexes in an increasingly complex fashion: as a baseline along which the manager intends to add value and manage risk; for determining which factor bets have most influenced overall portfolio returns (attribution analysis); and for determining the extent to which the manager adds value (through use of the information ratio, for instance). Managers typically use readily available published indexes for these purposes, although these indexes often do not accurately reflect the manager's true investment universe, and thus give rise to distortions and consequently poor information. "Strategy benchmarks" are often beneficial alternatives from the perspectives of client, consultant, and investment manager.</description><author>Kuenzi, D.

There is evidence that a few simple market timing strategies appear to have outperformed a buy-and-hold strategy in the 1970-2000 period. The example here is based on spreads between the E/P ratio of the S&amp;P 500 index and interest rates. Extremely narrow spreads compared to historical ranges appear to predict more frequent market downturns to come. A switching strategy based on extremely narrow spreads and the market index calls for investing in the stock market index unless spreads are narrower than some predefined threshold. Switching strategies like this outperformed the market index in terms of higher mean returns and lower variances. A strategy based on the spread between the E/P ratio and a short-term interest rate comfortably beat the market index in this period, even considering transaction costs.</description><author>Shen, P.</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2003 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Overconfidence bias in international stock prices - Consistent across countries and trading environments.</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Scott, J.; Stumpp, M.; Xu, P.
This study expands tests of the overconfidence hypothesis to international markets, where the evidence is consistent with the hypothesis that stock prices the world around are also biased by investor overconfidence. A novel aspect of the test here is combination of the overconfidence hypothesis with valuation theory. When stocks are categorized according to how quickly they are expected to grow, there is an interaction effect between earnings growth and the payoffs to contrarian and momentum strategies. Data from France, Germany, Japan, the U.K., and the U.S. show that successful investment strategies differ, depending on a stock's growth rate. A momentum strategy of buying stocks with positive earning estimate revisions and selling stocks with negative estimate revisions is significantly more profitable in fast-growth companies, for instance, while a contrarian strategy of buying low P/E stocks and selling high P/E stocks produces greater and more consistent profits in slow-growth companies. The results suggest that traditional value-oriented managers should focus on slow-growth companies, while successful growth managers should ride winners and be willing to sell when confronted with bad news.</description><author>Scott, J.; Stumpp, M.; Xu, P.</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2003 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Improving the efficient frontier - By pooling investment capital.</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Kwan, C.

Familiar portfolio concepts can explain why pooling of investor capital enables investors to achieve higher expected returns without additional risk exposure. The risk of the pooled investment must be a particular weighted average of the participating investors' preferred risks. Unveiling of the source of expected return improvements provides a clearer picture of what pooling can achieve. A variety of formulas to allocate the realized return from pooling among participating investors should help portfolio managers design effective allocation methods.</description><author>Kwan, C. C.

Investigation of the monthly return history of hedge funds over 1989-2000, however, finds there are it fact distinct styles of management that account for about 20% of the cross-sectional variability in performance. This result is consistent across the years in the sample and robust as to the way investment style is determined.

Hedge fund indexing, a seemingly attractive way to get general exposure to the hedge fund industry, may instead subject investors to many unskilled managers. After adjustment for market exposure and non-synchronous pricing/liquidity issues, the evidence is that the majority of hedge fund managers examined do not have statistically significant skill. Nor do indexes provide adequate diversification benefits in times of market dislocation. Simulations indicate that an actively managed fund of funds with good discernment can beat a passive hedge fund investment. Investors should thus be wary of taking a passive approach to investing in hedge funds. Passive index funds are not a good alternative to an active search for skilled hedge fund managers.</description><author>Liew, J.</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2003 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Are gain and loss respectable?

Following this logic, as typically the lowest-cost alternatives in their category, index Funds would be expected to rank among the top-performing funds in a category.

Analysis of institutional trading costs typically assumes that profit-maximizing fund managers seek to minimize trading costs. The authors suggest that the bundling of non-trading services into institutional trading commissions is far too pervasive for this assumption to hold generally. Bundling reflects an endemic principal-agent problem in the operation of collective investment schemes that acts to discourage efficient implementation of portfolio decisions taken on behalf of fundholders. Bundling results in excessive trade intermediation, generating higher market impact costs and discouraging the use of more efficient trading platforms (particularly for NYSE stocks). Furthermore, the authors argue that the widespread use of inefficient internal trading cost benchmarks, such as VWAP, makes it hard for institutions to detect the damage to fund performance that result, from bundling.</description><author>Schwartz, R.

This article examines two issues regarding initial equity public offerings (IPOs) of 775 firms that came to market between July 1, 1997, and December 31, 1999. First, a study of the underpricing of new issues indicates that first-day excess returns are greater for venture-backed IPOs, high-tech firms, and firms underwritten by top-rung investment bankers, and in months following high previous-month Nasdaq returns. Second, the authors look at the longer-run performance of IPOs and the effect of the so-called lock-up provision, which restricts initial founders and owners of the IPO from selling their shares for a period of time. They find a statistically significant increase in trading volume on the day following the unlock date. Prices begin to fall, however, prior to the end of the lock-up period as the market anticipates the selling that is likely to follow. There is a substantial negative excess return for shareholders who buy new issues in the open market immediately after the IPO.</description><author>Garfinkle, N.; Malkiel, B.

The returns of U.S. stocks and Treasury bonds are usually positively correlated, or coupled, As the stock market plunges, Treasury bonds tend to rally, and the daily returns become negatively correlated, or decoupled. In this article, the author examines the decoupling that accompanies stock market crashes. He begins by presenting empirical evidence of the stock-bond decoupling and next examines sonic implications. The main practical implication is that U.S. Treasury bonds offer effective diversification during financial crises, at the time it is needed most. The main theoretical implication is that normal probability distributions (both conditional and unconditional) generally misspecify the joint returns of U.S. stocks and Treasury bonds.</description><author>Gulko, L.</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2002 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Managing credit risk in a corporate bond portfolio - Selecting a portfolio with better return-risk characteristics.</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Ramaswamy, S.

Value at risk is perhaps the most common measure of a portfolio's exposure to loss. The simplest way to estimate value at risk is to calculate it directly from the portfolio's expected return and standard deviation under the assumption that the portfolio's returns are lognormally distributed. If the component returns of the portfolio are themselves lognormally distributed, however, it is incorrect to assume that the portfolio's returns are also lognormal. For portfolios that include only long positions, this technically false assumption is a reasonably good approximation of the portfolios' theoretical return distribution. For portfolios that include short positions, though, the authors explain why the assumption of lognormality for the total portfolio can be seriously misleading. In many typical cases, value at risk is substantially greater than indicated by a lognormal distribution.</description><author>Chow, G.; Kritzman, M.</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2002 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Alternative small-cap stock benchmarks - Recent performance and changes in characteristics.</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Reilly, F.

The authors compare the alternative benchmarks, and provide updated risk-return results fur the small-cap sector.

Standard &amp; Poor's has become increasingly aggressive in deleting stocks from the S&amp;P 500 index. Where once it made replacements in the index only when a particular stock had to be removed due to merger or acquisition, corporate restructuring, and bankruptcy filing, S&amp;P now voluntarily removes a company for a variety of reasons, which may include low market capitalization, low share price, dwindling market share, or simply the need to find a spot for an up-and-comer. There are a variety of impacts on share price and trading volume for stocks added to and deleted from the S&amp;P 500 during the period January 1996 through December 2001. For additions, abnormal returns and trading volumes are higher than ever. For deletions, share prices are dealt a crippling blow.</description><author>Beneish, M. D.; Whaley, R.

Capital allocation decisions become an even tougher issue without a consistent measure of credit risk across the entire portfolio. Although available risk management systems are helpful for a number of asset classes, none provides an adequate solution for real estate credit risk. With few appropriate inputs, and a notable lack of data on commercial mortgage default experience, an alternative approach to assessing real estate loan expected default frequency is needed. The authors discuss the calibration of a systematic risk metric to actual historical defaults. A comparison of the disaggregated results to those of past studies of defaults indicates that the metric appears to be a robust and useful tool for exposing opportunities and improving capital allocation decisions.</description><author>Pappadopoulos, G.

How much diversification is required in an investment-grade credit portfolio to achieve a desired level of risk relative to a broad credit benchmark? Two approaches to optimal portfolio structuring address this fundamental question from different viewpoints. The first seeks to minimize the risk of underperforming a benchmark because of idiosyncratic credit events; the second explores the diversification levels that maximize the information ratio (risk-adjusted outperformance of the benchmark). This study focuses on the impact of rating downgrades on security returns relative to peer groups. Data on the Lehman Brothers Credit Index as well as transition probabilities published by the rating agencies underlie a methodology for estimating portfolio downgrade risk and the optimal diversification levels. Simple models of the value of credit research help the reader analyze the trade-off between increased diversification and diminished performance.</description><author>Dynkin, L.; Hyman, J.; Konstantinovsky, V.</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2002 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Tax savings with mutual fund distributions - A quirk in the tax code.</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Singal, V.
Under the current tax code, investors receiving mutual fund distributions are subject to capital gains taxes based on the mutual fund's, not the investor's, holding period. Investors can use this wrinkle in the tax code to their benefit by converting short-term capital gains into long-term capital gains. An investor buys into a mutual fund with long-term capital gains just before its distribution date, and sells it immediately after the distribution. This process captures for the investor the long-term capital gains distributed, but also produces a short-term capital loss as the mutual fund price falls by the amount of the distribution. The short-term capital loss can be offset against other short-term capital gains of the investor. The investor can save on taxes because the capital gains are now long-term, not short-term. Current mutual fund shareholders are not hurt by the actions of these transitory investors, because the distributions are now divided into a greater number of shares, making the per share distribution smaller, and thereby reducing the tax liability of existing shareholders.</description><author>Singal, V.</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2002 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Investing for Growth in 1975 - Philosophy, criteria, and lessons.</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Barker, R.

The one absolute truth in investing is that long-range success comes only from rigorous pursuit of disciplines designed to neutralize emotional pressures. These disciplines differ because investors have different strengths and weaknesses, but all depend upon self-discipline, defining objectives, understanding the reasons underpinning the chosen strategy, recognizing the inevitable problems, and developing the strength to stay the course-and being sensitive to fundamental changes that could make the investor's chosen strategy obsolete. Endowments, despite the many compelling reasons for investing for maximum long-term return, at one time typically put too much emphasis on avoiding losses and on maximizing current returns, yielding results that would be recognized as unacceptable if performance had been accurately measured. The author of this opinion piece, written in the 1970s, led an investment office to acknowledged leadership among growth investors during the second half of the 20th century. His 1972 report on endowment investments for The Ford Foundation had a great impact on changes in endowment investment management.</description><author>Barker, R.

Prime brokers understand the importance of the securities lending industry in providing liquidity to markets, but most other participants view it simply as a source of incremental income for long-term investors. In fact, securities lending is a fundamental component of the short-selling market, and the income from lending is not trivial. This description of the very important securities lending industry provides the first in-depth exploration of the behavior of daily lending transactions in 24 countries for a two-year period in 2000-2002.

How do we quantify the level of return that an investor can expect in the future? An examination of the historical distribution of total returns reveals declines in dividend yields and new likely lower boundaries for price appreciation. It is often asserted that low dividend yields brought about by higher earnings retention should be followed by greater price appreciation as a firm invests retained earnings into new projects. The available recent evidence refutes this assertion. Barring some significant reversal of current conditions, short-term and possibly intermediate-term returns from stocks will be lower than what many investors may be anticipating.</description><author>Jones, C.

G.; de Silva, H.; Wander, B.
Most investors are exposed to both systematic and active risks in their portfolios. Systematic risks stem from consistent exposure to marketwide factors, and are usually associated with marketwide risk premiums. Active risk comes from actively managing underlying security and/or systematic risk exposures. Traditional long-only investment strategies are usually dominated by systematic risk, while alternative investment strategies typically have more active risk than systematic risk. A risk allocation framework that explicitly differentiates between these two sources of risk enables investors to improve the risk/return profile of their portfolios. Such a framework also enables investors to better incorporate non-traditional or alternative investment strategies into portfolios by characterizing them in terms of their systematic and active risk rather than thinking of them as a separate asset class.</description><author>Clarke, R.

Hard to argue that today</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Saunders, A.; Walter, I.
Historically, fund managers and investors making portfolio allocation decisions have considered emerging market equities a separate asset class. More recently, a number of economic, legal, accounting, and financial developments have eroded the root differences between emerging and developed country financial markets. These liberalizations include capital market reforms that have reduced the constraints and limits on foreign portfolio investment. The authors find that empirical evidence strongly supports the view that the world's financial markets are becoming increasingly integrated, and that the integration process encompasses emerging markets. As a result, the idea of a rigid separation between emerging market and developed market pools of investible funds (and adoption of separate performance benchmarks) seems no longer appropriate. Indeed, recent moves by international investors to benchmark their portfolios to MSCI's all-country world index and related world indexes, which include both emerging market and developed market securities, seem a step in this direction.</description><author>Saunders, A.; Walter, I.</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2002 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Visibility</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Bernstein, P.

M.; Arnott, R. D.
The need to rebalance institutional assets to a policy benchmark is a simple fact of life. While it may be possible for investors to allow portfolios to drift over a period of time, they will eventually have to address the misallocation this causes, as the mix becomes increasingly concentrated, overexposed to the riskier asset classes and underexposed to the more conservative asset classes. Some investors may rebalance the asset mix by systematically directing new money into the underweight asset classes or by choosing the overweight asset classes as a source for withdrawals. Others may choose to rebalance on a quarterly basis, before they are called upon to report to their investment committee. However loosely the constraints on active moves away from policy benchmark are defined, the authors argue that the fact remains that a fund's assets and liabilities must appropriately balance; drifting too far from the policy benchmark can prove disastrous when markets fail to deliver what one has been conditioned to expect.</description><author>Plaxco, L.

In this article the authors examine the problem of index tracking. Market capitalization-weighted indexes can be tracked by buying all the constituents at their actual weights, but the higher transaction and administration costs involved with this approach largely make this a non-practical solution. Minimizing a portfolio's tracking error with respect to the benchmark with a relatively small number of stocks is the central focus of the authors. They describe current portfolio optimization methods for the problem, and present a new mathematical optimization method that not only gives better results but also may be able to tackle other problems in portfolio optimization. The findings can easily be extended to solve portfolio construction problems that incorporate expected returns, variance of returns, transaction costs, and additional constraints.</description><author>Jansen, R.; van Dijk, R.</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2002 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>The Perils of Success - The impact of asset growth on small-capitalization investment manager performance.</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Christopherson, J.; Ding, Z.

The original idea of a low-cost, low-turnover, diversified portfolio has been replaced by funds that deliver only on their pledges of low turnover and diversification. The concentration of trading around index changes causes investors to incur transaction costs far higher than the pioneers of indexing anticipated.

This article derives and applies a performance measure of a portfolio manager's value-added called "style pricing." The value-added is obtained by treating the per period payoffs from the managed portfolio as a financial claim, contingent on the payoffs from other marketed assets. The relevant marketed assets are those that describe the style of the managed portfolio's returns in a precise way. The price of the contingent claim is obtained using martingale methods so that there is zero arbitrage between the portfolio's payoffs and the payoffs from the replicating contingent claim. As the authors explain, the style pricing approach may be applied to any management style, is directly measured in dollars, and is readily comparable to the portfolio manager's remuneration and the fees payable.</description><author>Korkie, R.

The authors explain the long-term risk-return characteristics of venture capital investment and its role in a long-term strategic asset allocation. While there are limited market performance data on venture capital, they find that from 1960 through 1999, venture capital has had an annual arithmetic average return of 45% with a standard deviation of 115.6%. The geometric average return (compounded average) is estimated to be about 13%. The correlation coefficient between venture capital and public stocks is estimated to be 0.04%. Because of its relatively low correlation with stocks, an allocation to venture capital of 2% to 9% is warranted for an aggressive portfolio (i.e., all-equity).</description><author>Chen, P.; Baierl, G.

The authors examine the process of price discovery at the New York Stock Exchange single-price opening auction. The analysis sheds light on the role of the specialist and provides insights into how openings on other markets-such as Nasdaq-might be structured. In particular, the presence of designated dealers facilitates price discovery over an automated call auction market, perhaps because specialists obtain valuable information by observing the evolution of the limit order book. In addition, the specialist's opening trade reflects non-information factors such as price stabilization requirements. Finally, the authors note that it is not feasible to trade thin stocks in call markets without either the presence of a designated dealer or a high degree of transparency.</description><author>Madhavan, A.; Panchapagesan, V.</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2002 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Emerging markets - Managing the impact of high costs.</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Masters, S.

Previous research demonstrated how current measures of risk-adjusted performance are insufficient for ranking investment managers or structuring portfolios, and provided an alternative measure called correlation-adjusted performance (CAP). The new measure accounts for differences in standard deviations, the correlation between portfolios and the benchmark, and the fact that investors have a target relative risk. In this article, the author extends the analysis for institutional investors with multiple manager portfolios. This technique facilitates optimal portfolio construction by combining the risk-free asset, the benchmark, and many investment managers. Since managers are less than perfectly correlated with each other, unattractive managers on a stand-alone basis may be chosen for their diversification properties and overall risk-adjusted performance can be increased over that of the highest yielding manager. The author also shows that the case for passive management is greatly diminished under this paradigm.</description><author>Muralidhar, A.

Be cautious in analyzing monthly returns.</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Asness, C.; Krail, R.; Liew, J.
Many hedge funds claim to provide significant diversification for traditional portfolios, besides attractive returns. The authors provide empirical evidence regarding the return and diversification benefits of hedge fund investing using the CSFB/Tremont hedge fund indexes over 1994-2000. Like many others, they find that simple regressions of monthly hedge fund excess returns on monthly S&amp;P 500 excess returns seem to support the claims about the benefits of hedge funds. The regressions show only modest market exposure and positive added value. This type of analysis can produce misleading results, however. Many hedge funds hold, to various degrees and combinations, illiquid exchange-traded securities or difficult-to-price over-the-counter securities. For the purposes of monthly reporting, hedge funds often price these securities using either the last available traded prices or estimates of current market prices. These practices can lead to reported monthly hedge fund returns that are not perfectly synchronous with monthly S&amp;P 500 returns. Non-synchronous return data can lead to understated estimates of actual market exposure. When the authors apply standard techniques that account for this problem, they find that hedge funds in the aggregate have significantly more market exposure than simple estimates indicate. Furthermore, after accounting for this increased market exposure, they find that taken as a whole the broad universe of hedge funds does not add value over this period.</description><author>Asness, C.; Krail, R.; Liew, J.</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 2001 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Optimal portfolios of foreign currencies - Trading on the forward bias.</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Baz, J.; Breedon, F.; Naik, V.; Peress, J.
Empirical evidence suggests that forward exchange rates are biased predictors of future spot exchange rates. Currencies with higher nominal interest rates tend to appreciate rather than depreciate as predicted by the forward rates. Simultaneously, exchange rates also turn out to be notoriously difficult to predict using plausible macroeconomic variables. The authors demonstrate how these two hypotheses can be combined with standard mean-variance analysis to construct optimal currency portfolios. They simulate the optimal portfolio strategies on historically observed data for the period 1989-1999 for DEM, JPY, GBP, and CHF (with the USD as the base currency). These portfolios generate positive excess returns. Moreover, the returns on optimal currency portfolios do not appear to be correlated with the returns on major fixed-income and equity indexes.

This study presents a method to select corporate bonds that outperform the corporate bond market as a whole. The approach has many similarities to the well-investigated field of stock selection strategies. The literature suggests several variables that are successful for the selection of outperforming stocks. The filters the authors investigate to select outperforming bonds will be even more useful because the fixed-income universe is so much larger, with more than 10,000 issues available. The authors test equity-related and bond-specific variables for selecting outperforming corporate bonds. After testing all the individual variables, they combine the most promising variables into one strategy. They achieve better-than-average performance in a corporate bond portfolio if they select bonds with a high spread valuation, a low spread return in recent months, and positive equity earnings revisions. The promising results are robust to several sensitivity tests.</description><author>Hottinga, J.; van Leeuwen, E.; van IJserloo, J.</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 2001 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>The Smith Company - Earn a profit, and pass on a reasonable portion to owners.</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Anonymous

Y.
Risk budgeting has become a buzzword. While there may be no generally accepted definition or approaches for implementation, the underlying concept of risk budgeting remains sound and relevant. Defining risk as "uncertainty of alpha," the authors argue that successful implementation of risk budgeting requires assessment of the quality of one's information under uncertainty (which the authors define as information risks), as well as other statistical risk measurement. Using a global asset allocation portfolio as an example, the authors introduce a simple optimal risk budgeting tool. With information risks, investment views, and total risk budget as inputs, the framework presented provides the optimal combination of information advantage so that the allocation of risks across strategies and assets is consistent with a manager's assessment of information risks and investment views.</description><author>Lee, W.; Lam, D.

Recent advances in on-line portfolio trading have brought investors much closer to achieving the frictionless model often assumed in portfolio theory. Taxes, though, remain a significant barrier. The authors show that even a passive equity fund, such as the Vanguard 500, has a significant drag in the form of taxes, leaving an investor with only 54% of pre-tax value after 24 years. They find that passive portfolio investors can reduce taxes substantially by selling losing stocks and replacing them with characteristically matched stocks. The authors provide an analytic framework to quantify the effects of taxes on investment returns. The pre-tax returns are affected by two components: short versus long tax rates, and forgone earnings. They isolate the two effects to assess their extent. Using the effective tax rate as a measure of the tax drag, they find that the theoretical cost of forgone earnings is as high as 30% and that the theoretical cost of realizing short-term gains is as high as 31%. Different real-world equity strategies to reduce the investor's effective tax rates are found to cut taxes by as much as 4.8%, significantly increasing the after-tax return.</description><author>Chincarini, L.; Kim, D.</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 2001 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Tracking S&amp;P 500 index funds - Getting your money's worth?</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Frino, A.; Gallagher, D.

Although index funds have grown significantly in the 1990s, empirical research concerning these passive investment offerings is surprisingly scarce. While the theory and objectives of an index strategy are both simple and well known, potential difficulties arise for index managers attempting to replicate the returns of the target benchmark. The source of the problem is that the underlying index is measured as a paper portfolio, and there is an implication that simple duplication is achievable without cost. In reality, tracking error in index fund performance is unavoidable because of market frictions. The authors highlight the difficulties faced by index funds. They examine both the extent and the variation of tracking error over time for S&amp;P 500 index mutual funds, and provide a direct performance comparison between index funds and active mutual funds. The findings indicate that S&amp;P 500 index funds, on average, outperformed active funds after expenses over the sample period.</description><author>Frino, A.; Gallagher, D.

Improvements in technology and increasing emphasis on performance have led many investors to monitor the performance of fund managers on a high-frequency basis: quarterly, monthly, or more frequently. The authors examine the impact that frequency of performance measurement has on the probability distribution of observed outcomes. With more frequent monitoring of rolling returns, there is a greatly increased probability of observing seemingly extreme observations. The authors demonstrate that if performance is appraised by focusing on returns to date, it is important to adjust the definition of extreme performance for the frequency with which returns are monitored. Failure to do so may lead to costly actions such as strategy revisions or manager terminations, which increase transaction costs and have detrimental effects on manager incentives.</description><author>Dimson, E.; Jackson, A.</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 2001 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Why real estate?

Institutional investors have traditionally viewed real estate as a risk-reducer, diversifying portfolios in line with the fiduciary responsibilities imposed by ERISA. This is not the oi-dy role that the asset class can fill. Peal estate can obviously help make a portfolio market-neutral and more reflective of the overall investment universe. Can it also reduce the overall risk of a portfolio, provide high absolute returns, act as an inflation hedge, and offer strong cash flows? Recently, the equity market has faltered, and the specters of inflation and recession now haunt the collective psyche of the investor. Why real estate? Is the answer more compelling now than in the late 1990s?

A primary motivation for investing in hedge funds and commodity funds is to diversify against falling stock prices. The authors evaluate the performance of 16 different such funds during rising and falling stock markets between 1990 and 1998 both as stand-alone assets and as portfolio assets. They use the Sharpe ratio and alternative safety-first criteria to evaluate performance. The conclusion is that commodity funds generally provide more downside protection than hedge funds. Commodity funds have higher returns in bear markets than hedge funds, and generally have an inverse correlation with stock returns in bear markets. Hedge funds typically exhibit a higher positive correlation with stock returns in bear markets than in bull markets. Three hedge fund styles-market-neutral, event-driven, and global macro-provide fairly good downside protection with more attractive returns over all markets than commodity funds.</description><author>Edwards, F.

The unbiased expectations hypothesis is the basis for many current investment strategies, despite its shortcomings. Yet the spot-forward parity theorem and the unbiased expectations hypothesis cannot both hold. Why do some in the investment community continue to believe that there is any more information in forward prices or rates than spot prices or rates? The authors show that forward prices have to be biased predictors of future spot prices, or arbitrage opportunities would arise. The bias is fair compensation for the difference in the timing of the cash flows between the spot and forward markets. The authors argue that the unbiased expectations hypothesis often forms the basis for trading strategies only because of the zero initial value and non-zero future value, the misuse of forwards in performance attribution, and a misunderstanding of the symmetry of risk premiums.</description><author>Chance, D.

Academic respondents in general, and the microstructure subset in particular, are relatively positive about market quality and the efficacy of regulatory initiatives. The predominant response on both the sell-side and the buy-side is that the quality of the U.S. equity markets has deteriorated in recent years.

A challenge for modern portfolio managers and security analysts is understanding the variables or factors that drive security returns. Statistical methods such as principal components analysis are useful but lack meaningful interpretations. Peal economic factors comport with intuitive understanding but lack explanatory power. This study seeks to bridge the gap between these two approaches by interpreting "statistical factors" using economic factors. The authors examine the factor structure of equity portfolio returns widely used in a sample period from 1963 through 1999. They find there are three major factors for equity returns, which can be associated with 1) the market return; 2) market capitalization; and 3) the investment opportunity set. Higher-order factors can be uniquely identified with macroeconomic variables.</description><author>Merville, L. J.; Hayes-Yelken, S.; Xu, Y.

Global factors are playing an increasingly important role in the pricing of securities. It is a new challenge to identify, the sources of those global factors and to structure portfolios that exploit the reward-to-risk opportunities from variation in these factors. The authors build on research suggesting that industry factors capture an economically important component of the variation in security returns. postulating a risk model that explicitly accounts for regional sector rotation decisions, they find that sensitivities to foreign factors are positively associated with the extent of firms' foreign sales activities. This provides empirical support for a reduced-form structural model, and it suggests that foreign sales data can be used as a conditioning variable to obtain economically sensible risk factor sensitivities.</description><author>Cavaglia, S.; Cho, D.; Singer, B.</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 2001 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Parameter estimation techniques, optimization frequency, and portfolio return enhancement</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Larsen, G.

Modern portfolio theory dictates that the lower the pairwise correlation between securities, the greater the potential for efficiency enhancement from ex ante optimization. When securities exhibit a high degree of pairwise correlation, ex ante optimization should provide less potential for efficiency enhancement. It is an empirical issue as to whether ex ante return estimation and optimization techniques can provide strict return enhancement in risk-return space. Strict return enhancement, without the use of leverage, may be possible if ex ante portfolio parameter estimation techniques allow securities with higher realized returns to carry greater weights in the ex ante optimal portfolio than in the benchmark portfolio. The authors of this article examine how various ex ante portfolio parameter estimation techniques and optimization/holding-period frequency intervals can enhance managed portfolio returns. Overall, the results suggest that it is possible to consistently achieve enhanced returns at much the same level of return per unit of risk as the benchmark portfolio.</description><author>Larsen, G.

This article presents a framework for allocating partial tracking errors to investment decisions in order to maximize the expected information ratio of an actively managed portfolio. The tracking error allocation framework is a three-step process: 1) identifying the independent investment decisions; 2) ranking the forecasting capabilities for the investment decisions; and 3) calculating the optimum partial tracking errors, given an overall tracking error limit. The key result is an understandable and transparent rule that says the target tracking error for each investment decision should be proportional to the corresponding expected information ratio. The authors illustrate the framework using examples that show some interesting practical consequences of an optimum tracking error allocation.</description><author>Blitz, D.

The authors examine the impact of fund size on investment performance. Ultimately every investment strategy will become self-defeating when too much money chases the same opportunity. It has therefore become common practice among successful fund managers to close funds to new money. It is mostly a mystery as to where and how this line gets drawn, especially since these restrictions are almost invariably lifted (with the pressure of increased client demand). Every asset management strategy has a natural limit beyond which growing a fund will significantly retard performance. The authors use real-life simulations to document how soon a performance drag sets in and how significant it is. They thus provide a framework to establish maximum fund size.</description><author>Beckers, S.; Vaughan, G.</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 2001 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Mind-sets over matter</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Bernstein, P.

The phenomenal growth of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) is a frequent topic in the financial press. These funds, with assets more than doubling each year since 1995, have been warmly embraced by most advocates of low-cost index funds. Vanguard, the leading advocate of index funds, has announced plans to add exchange-traded share classes to a number of its domestic index funds. Most of the press coverage has correctly noted the major advantages of ETFs-low-costs, intraday trading and high tax efficiency with no material premiums or discounts to the funds' intraday net asset value. However, there is a fair degree of misusunderstanding about how ETFs work, what sectors of the market are good candidates for ETFs and what sectors are not, why the expense ratios tend to be low, and how most of the funds manage to avoid significant capital gains distributions. In this article, the author attempts to answer these and other questions frequently asked by investors.</description><author>Gastineau, G.

M.
For more than 20 years pension and endowment funds have used multiple active investment managers With complementary styles to manage their U.S. common stocks. Theory tells us that the approach-diversifying with active managers-is suboptimal. Evidence presented by the author supports the theory indicating that the strategy has underperformed by the margin of its cost, which is approximately 1.2% per year. Passive management is one solution, and passive allocations have risen steadily for 20 years. Many funds, however, demonstrate reluctance to pursue a purely passive approach. The author recommends that those funds consider employing one or more whole portfolios in managing their active U.S. equity assets. Successfully employed in managing fixed income and international equities, whole portfolios embrace the totality of the opportunity set represented by the asset class. Whole portfolios allow investment managers to make a broader range of relative-value judgments than occurs under the multiple-specialist model. At the same time their use frees the client h-om having to manage the collective style of several active managers, eliminating in the process fairly arbitrary and rigid boundaries within the active equity portfolio. Using whole portfolios is also conducive to hiring fewer managers, an important step in avoiding "closet indexing.".</description><author>Ennis, R.

Four of the eight firms nominally outperforIned the Robot Blend after transaction costs, confirming the random chance prediction. The dynamic asset allocation model that used analysts' forecasts outperformed all other models. This result is robust to the application of reasonable constraints to the dynamic models. The authors suggest that dynamic asset allocation models probably will not outperform fixed-weight asset allocation unless they employ superior analyst judgment.

Several empirical studies show a systematic relationship between stack characteristics (size, earnings yield, dividend yield, etc.) and stock returns. Previous studies that show stocks with high earnings yield produce superior returns use univariate measures (such as E/P or B/P) to classify stocks into value or growth stocks. The authors show that the traditional method of classification ignores instances when value and growth investing strategies, instead of being mutually exclusive, can complement each other in selecting superior performing stocks. Growth in EPS provides a more meaningful way to capture growth than using a measure of low E/P ratio. A strategy focusing on investing in stocks that have the dual characteristics of a high E/P ratio and high growth in EPS outperforms a strategy of high E/P alone. The authors also document some evidence of persistence in performance for stocks having the dual characteristics of high growth in EPS and high E/P ratio.</description><author>Ahmed, P.; Nanda, S.</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 2001 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>The death of the risk premium - Consequences of the 1990s.</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Arnott, R.

The authors contend that most of the institutional investing community is expecting far higher returns than are realistic fi-om current market levels. Extrapolating the past is the easiest, and worst, way to forecast the future. Unfortunately, most investors' return expectations are shaped by a simple extrapolation of either recent or longterm past returns. If, instead, the constituent parts of equity market returns an examined, we find that it is remarkably difficult to make a case for a positive equity risk premium (the premium of future stock market returns relative to bond yields) from current market levels. None of this analysis is contingent on any assumption that market P/E ratios or dividend yields should return to historical levels. If market levels are fair and are fully sustained in the years ahead, there is still little or no room for a positive equity risk premium. If there is not a positive risk premium, then actuarial return assumptions are likely to be too optimistic, with far-reaching implications for pension funding ratios, corporate earnings, future pension contributions, and appropriate asset allocation policy.</description><author>Arnott, R.

The authors examine the cross-section of expected stock returns between 1985 and 1994 and find a strong negative relationship between market value added per share (MVA) and average returns. When the joint effect of MVA, firm size, and the ratio of price-to-book value is examined, the explanatory power of size and the price-to-book value for the cross-section of average returns is substantially diminished, but MVA is still strongly related to returns. These results suggest three possibilities: that MVA is serving as a proxy for a risk factor that affects equilibrium expected returns, that current poor performance will be reversed in the future as the mean-reverting hypothesis suggests, or that low MVA firms are relatively underpriced.</description><author>Yook, K.

The authors provide evidence that the power of book-to-market and size attributes in explaining the cross-section of stock returns may, in part, lie in the fact that these concepts subsume useful information regarding both the probability of bankruptcy and recovery rates. Other research that focuses primarily on the probability of default concludes that investors do not care about financial distress risk. The authors argue, however, that this conclusion may be premature, as the evidence suggests that investors are concerned, ex ante, about recovery rate risk as well. The findings here have important portfolio management implications.</description><author>Akgun, A.; Gibson, R.</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 2001 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Risk diversification benefits of multiple-stock portfolios</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>de Vassal, V.
During the past seven years, not everyone with equity holdings may have profited front the extraordinary bull market. Private investors with large concentrated holdings in only one or a few stocks are vulnerable to significant risk of underperforming. The author of this article provides a useful framework for explaining the risk-return benefits of adding stocks to a portfolio. The analysis uses Monte Carlo techniques to simulate total returns of equity portfolios with varying numbers of holdings for the seven-year period ending December 31, 1999. The universe is based on the original constituents of the Russell 1000 as of December 31, 1992, adjusted for survivorship. The results suggest significant risk reduction benefits can be achieved by adding only a small number of stocks to a nondiversified portfolio.</description><author>de Vassal, V.</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 2001 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Life cycle investing, holding periods, and risk</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Hickman, K.; Hunter, H.; Byrd, J.; Beck, J.; Terpening, W.

The fixed-income literature is concerned with hedging strategies for controlling the interest rate risk of assets and liabilities held domestically in a single currency. That there is little research dedicated to international immunization may reflect a view that companies and financial institutions dealing internationally need only replicate a single-currency hedging strategy ill each country. The authors argue that separate immunization in each country is overly restrictive and may be costly to execute. Instead, they propose a less restrictive strategy treating the assets and liabilities held across currencies as portfolios, and matching the duration of those portfolios. Their immunization strategy should directly reduce the cost of international hedging against interest risk, and indirectly reduce the cost of hedging against currency risk. Simulation results suggest that the proposed strategy should be at least as effective as well as cheaper to implement.</description><author>Hauser, S.; Rozenkranz, M.; Ben-Zion, U.; Yaari, U.</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 2001 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Managing market risk for an emerging market debt portfolio</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Martins, L. E.; Petrov, C.; Kelly, J. M.
Investors in the emerging debt market are exposed to a number of different types of risk, most importantly market risk. This article introduces a risk metric called beta spread duration (BSD), which is designed to measure aggregate market risk. BSD builds on two well-known metrics, beta and spread duration, and applies them to the emerging debt market. The authors demonstrate that BSD is a statistically significant measure of overall market risk and identify its limitations. They show that while market risk explains the majority of spread changes, individual country risk still matters. Indeed, they show that large changes in country risk call dominate overall market risk over shorter time frames while also exhibiting statistical significance over longer periods.</description><author>Martins, L.

With rising turnover in institutional portfolios, investment managers are paying increasing attention to transaction costs. The authors provide some insight into managing costs in an approach that assumes trading is a process, not an event. In the process, there are three actors: portfolio manager, in-house trader, and broker, each with its own period of discretion. Costs of transacting should be attributed to the different actors according only to their periods of discretion. High-turnover portfolios should invest in systems that would allow estimation of the costs attributable to each actor's decisions. The authors illustrate how this might be done.</description><author>Berkowitz, S. A.; Logue, D.

In his testimony on Social Security System reform before Congress in 1999, Alan Greenspan voiced the opinion that it is not feasible to manage public pension funds without political interference. Poor performance is the result. This article's author beg to differ. A recent study shows no difference in the performance of large samples of U.S. public sector and corporate pension funds. It is not the type of sponsorship that drives performance, the author argues, but the quality of a fund's governance and management processes. Public funds are no less likely to be endowed with these qualities than their private sector counterparts.</description><author>Ambachtsheer, K.

While risk budgets are the new fashion among investment managers, the investment community has yet to agree on the precise meaning of the term, or, more important, on how risk budgeting relates to asset allocation. Intuitively, a risk budget conveys the notion that a portfolio's risk is somehow apportioned to various categories, but such disaggregation is impossible for many descriptions of risk. The authors explore the issues associated with risk budgets with a view to arriving at a clear and uniform understanding of risk budgets and their role in the investment process.</description><author>Chow, G.; Kritzman, M.</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 2001 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Why the low returns to beta and other forms of risk</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Miller, E. M.
High-beta stocks typically fail to outperform low-beta stocks. Investors have heterogeneous opinions about value, and the difference between the return expected by the marginal investor and by the typical investor increases with the divergence of opinion. The author suggests that the divergence of opinion diminishes following an initial public offering, producing long-run underperformance of such offerings.. Because divergence of opinion, uncertainty, and beta risk are correlated, according to the author, this causes an uncertainty-induced bias that increases with beta, producing a relatively aat security market line, natter than the risk-return relationship anticipated by the typical investor. An implication of this theory is that investors can improve their return relative to risk by exploiting the flatness of the security market line.</description><author>Miller, E.

Many investors think of active and passive management as mutually exclusive approaches in investment management; they are proponents of either active or passive management. In the view of the authors, it is more useful to think of these investment management approaches as lying along a continuum, with passive management using index replication at one end of the continuum, and active management using aggressively concentrated portfolios at the other end. Both investment management approaches have benefits and shortcomings. By combining active and passive approaches to investment management, plan sponsors, foundations, and endowments can maximize the benefit potential and may minimize the shortcoming; of each to improve overall portfolio results. The authors compare the two approaches, discuss their historical performance, and present a framework for combining the two on a strategic (long-run), tactical (medium-run), and dynamic (short-run) basis.</description><author>Flood, E.; Ramachandran, N.</author><pubDate>Sat, 01 Jan 2000 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Value of skill in security selection versus asset allocation in credit markets - An "imperfect foresight" study.</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Dynkin, L.; Hyman, J.; Wu, W.
The authors of this article simulate several styles of fixed-income portfolio management using a variation of the "perfect foresight" approach and explore performance at manager skill levels ranging h-om 0% (random selection) to 100% (perfect foresight). The portfolio strategies are designed so as to isolate the management styles: duration allocation, sector allocation, quality allocation, and security selection. Information ratios are reported for each strategy at various levels of manager skill. At equivalent levels of skill, the strategy based on security selection outperforms duration allocation and sector/quality allocation techniques in terms of information ratios. The number of independent decisions in the allocation process is a key determinant of strategy success. The advantage of security selection lies in the diversification of risk provided by making many security selection decisions simultaneously. This does not negate the importance of duration decision-making in fixed-income portfolio management.</description><author>Dynkin, L.; Hyman, J.; Wu, W.</author><pubDate>Sat, 01 Jan 2000 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>The decision tree approach to stock selection - An evolving tree model performs the best.</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Sorensen, E.

A frequent question regarding quantitative investing is: What are good variables for stock selection? Traditional quantitative strategies are variations of screening techniques. Quantitative investment managers seek to narrow the investable universe to a manageable number of stocks that have desirable characteristics. The authors introduce an alternative approach to traditional methods of stock screening based on a statistical technique known as classification and regression tree (CART). CART allows screening factors to interact on a conditional basis. The end result is a hierarchical (tree) structure that assigns a probability of outperformance (or underperformance) for each stock. The authors apply two alternative CART strategies to the selection of technology stocks, and evaluate their performance. The models demonstrate significant improvement over the more ad hoc stock ranking techniques.</description><author>Sorensen, E. H.; Miller, K. L.; Ooi, C.

A common problem for taxable investors is how much to diversify either a low cost basis single-asset or concentrated portfolio. While tax-exempt theory is clear on the benefits of diversification, and there are useful industry methods for addressing this, in the presence of taxes there are no standard approaches to arriving at a considered choice. The authors propose an analytic and intuitive framework for addressing the problem, considering only two investment alternatives. By defining a tax-deferred equivalent of the taxable investor, they are able to adapt standard analytical methods and view the diversification decision in the presence of taxes as a conventional risk-return trade-off, provided the appropriate tax-deferred performance measures are used. Greater diversification is needed with greater initial asset volatility, with longer investment horizons, with lower expected return of the initial asset, and with a higher cost basis. Less diversification is needed when the investor receives a step-up in basis at the horizon. The results highlight the substantial risks incurred in concentrated holdings and often support high levels of diversification, even in the face of taxes.</description><author>Stein, D.

The high volatility of rates of returns on bonds during the 1980s received a great deal of attention because it is readily acknowledged that bond return volatility is critical to the analysis and management of bonds. Yet there has been no detailed analysis of bond market volatility for the pre-1980 period that would allow the experience during the 1980s and the 1990s to be put into perspective. The authors analyze the changing volatility of the government bond market over the past 50 years and examine how these changes compare to the well-documented volatility changes for the stock market. A comparison of Treasury bond market volatility to stock market volatility indicates that the volatility for these two markets has differed dramatically over time. The difference in volatility is confirmed by an analysis of the systematic risk of bonds versus stocks and the moving correlations between bonds and stock over time. In both instances, the pattern indicates a very cyclical series with wide ranges, but also a positive trend. An analysis of the time series properties of bond and stock volatility like-wise indicates significant differences.</description><author>Reilly, F. K.; Wright, D. J.; Chan, K.

The twentieth century was a turbulent time for equity investors. The author reviews price volatility over the past 700 years in general and equity volatility over the past 100 years in particular. The greatest sources of risk to equity investors in the twentieth century were price instability and resulting financial crises, wars, expropriations, and political upheavals. With respect to price volatility, the twentieth century was the most extreme by a wide margin with the most erratic price changes (deflation in the 1930s and inflation in the 1970s) occurring in the past 100 years. Given the unpredictability of past events, the author argues that an investment strategy biased on managing risk in the future could be a better approach to dealing with uncertainty than trying to guess what the future might hold.</description><author>Ineichen, A.

Institutionalization of securities markets and the increasingly rich research resources of institutional investors and the sophisticated market intermediaries that supply them with data, information, and judgment have profoundly changed the nature of the investor's working enviroment. Winning the "Loser's Game" is getting harder and harder. The author argues that investing can be "unbundled" into different levels of difficulty and cost. Ironically, cost and success are in conflict. He argues that investment professionals and their clients are least likely to succeed at the most costly level of investing: buying and selling individual securities. Both managers and investors would be wise to refocus on the highest level of investing: determining realistic long-term objectives, formulating realistic policies to achieve their objectives, and sustaining wise commitments. At this higher level of the game, everyone can be a winner.</description><author>Ellis, C.

Given that there is a maximum amount of possible excess return available to the pension fund buyers (an amount that can grow at the expense of other alpha producers), in the aggregate this group reduces value if there is oversupply.

The author argues that clients and their consultants can help investment managers widen their scope by structuring mandates in ways that are not: currently conventional.

Their tests of daily patterns for sixty issues traded for all or part of the interval between October 1994 and July 1997 show that: 1) the level of trading is consistently higher on Tuesday through Thursday than on either Monday or Friday, and 2) bond prices tend to significantly rise on Tuesday and decline on Friday. They interpret these results as supporting this rule of timing transactions: Investors seeking to sell high-yield corporate bonds should try to do so near the close on Tuesday or on either Wednesday or Thursday, while those who want to buy them should do so near the close on Friday or on Monday.</description><author>Alexander, G.

S.; Friedman, J. A.; Krail, R. J.; Liew, J. M.
Both academic and industry research supports the long-term efficacy of value strategies for choosing individual stocks. Value strategies are far from riskless, however. They can have long periods of poor performance. In an effort to improve upon these strategies, the authors have tried to forecast these returns with mixed results. Most of these "style timing" models are based on macroeconomic factors. The authors take a different approach considering two simple factors: 1) the spread in valuation multiples between a value portfolio and a growth portfolio (the value spread), and 2) the spread in expected earnings growth between a growth portfolio and a value portfolio (the earnings growth spread). They find that the greater the value spread and the smaller the earnings growth spread, the better their forecast for value versus growth going forward. These results are statistically and economically strong.</description><author>Asness, C. S.; Friedman, J. A.; Krail, R. J.; Liew, J.

The authors demonstrate that the usual application of the return-based style analysis relies on commercially available indexes that exhibit extreme multicollinearity. The subsequent results are volatile and have little meaning. As a result, the authors argue that implementing return-based style analysis with commercially available indexes can result in inaccurate and inappropriate investment decision-making. Even with multicollinearity, however, they demonstrate that the results of the analysis can be meaningful as long as the explanatory variables properly capture the investment objective of the portfolio. The authors conclude that the only way to implement return-based analysis is to use portfolio-specific benchmarks that properly capture the investment objectives of the portfolio.</description><author>Buetow, G.

In this article the authors examine the effects of book-to-market value (BE/ME) on portfolio selection and efficiency. The authors classify U.S. stocks into six value/size categories and generate a large number of random portfolios for each value/size category. Using a range of portfolio ranking criteria ria, they show that portfolios composed of high BE/ME stocks significantly dominate those of low BE/ME stocks, Portfolios composed of high BE/ME stocks perform better than randomly selected portfolios. These results obtain for all ranking criteria and for all portfolio sizes examined.</description><author>Chow, K. V.; Hulburt, H.

Selecting active managers and structuring their use has historically been more art than science. The authors explain why a manager structure can and should be approached as a problem of portfolio construction, a view that brings a whole set of tools to bear on the problem. This approach suggests optimizing to maximize expected active returns while controlling active risks. For a given risk budget, there is a single combination of the candidate managers who will best maximize the risk-adjusted expected active return of the portfolio. An optimized approach will also solve the active-passive or core-satellite allocation problem, a perennial area of indecision. The passive or core managers will naturally be held by the optimizer in inverse proportion to the active risk budget. This approach can be easily modified to process off-benchmark managers and to incorporate an optimal completion solution as part of the overall structure. This is a practical and robust manager structure solution appropriate to any investor using multiple managers or interested in the optimal active-passive mix.</description><author>Waring, B.; Whitney, D.; Pirone, J.; Castille, C.</author><pubDate>Sat, 01 Jan 2000 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Equity duration, growth options, and asset pricing - The context is important in evaluation of equity duration.</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Cornell, B.
Because much of the value of equity depends on option characteristics of investment projects, if is not feasible to calculate equity duration directly. As a result, recent literature has focused on estimating equity duration empirically.

The authors analyze che returns of nine emerging markets for the period from 1976 through 1997.

In addition, the authors demonstrate the importance of rebalancing and its effect on both the risk and return of an emerging market portfolio.</description><author>Eaker, M.; Grant, D.; Woodard, N.</author><pubDate>Sat, 01 Jan 2000 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>The market's best months - They are not random; there is pattern.</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Seligman, P.

This research demonstrates that the greatest monthly gains in the S&amp;P 500 directly follow corrections. It appears as if the cor rections themselves are the source of the exceptional performance. The author also categorizes corrections using objective criteria because the length of the rebound following a correction can be estimated by knowing the type of correction. The impact of these two insights on market performance is captured in a hypothetical timing model. The model outperforms the S&amp;P by 3.9 percentage points a year for fifty years but requires being invested only 40% of the time. The model is not intended to be a money making scheme, but instead a device to demonstrate the power of these ideas as they would play out in a quasi-real life scenario.</description><author>Seligman, P.

In principle, the risks in capital markets are relatively easy to assess and to manage because there is no such thing as a bad capital market risk, only a mispriced one. The author argues that too narrow a focus on those risks misses the equally important "meta-risks," those that pass beyond capital market risks. Here there are bad ones. They are intrinsically more difficult to identify, assess, and manage because they center around people and organizations and their interactions. For these risks, the author argues that an open dialectic of risk may be the ultimate form of risk management.</description><author>Gray, J.</author><pubDate>Sat, 01 Jan 2000 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>In search of the meaning of risk</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Bernstein, P.

The Chicago Board Options Exchange's Market Volatility Index (VIX) is called the "investor fear gauge." To understand why, it is necessary to understand the index's construction. To understand how VIX performs its role, it is necessary to examine its history and its relation to stock market returns. In this article, the author describes the construction of the volatility index and examines its movements over the past fourteen years.</description><author>Whaley, R.

The inability of active managers to consistently outperform capitalization-weighted benchmarks can be explained by a mismatch between those benchmarks and the underlying nature of active management. The authors show that this mismatch cannot be effectively addressed either through macro-level risk controls or through improved stock selection. They develop a new approach to risk management that emphasizes diversification at the individual stock level and offers significant improvements in risk-return efficiency and portfolio manager consistency; this new approach to risk management is also significantly easier to incorporate into a bottom-up investment process. Plan sponsors can further improve the value of active management through combinations of new, more portfolio manager-friendly active manager benchmarks and completion indexes that move the overall allocations back to their original capitalization-weighted benchmarks.</description><author>Strongin, S.; Petsch, M.; Sharenow, G.</author><pubDate>Sat, 01 Jan 2000 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>An optimal frontier - Using pooling to go beyond the efficient frontier.</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Schirripa, F.; Tecotzky, N. D.
The optimal frontier investment method described here represents a new portfolio construction process that relies on well-established practices and theory. It incorporates the insurance concept of risk-pooling into the Markowitz portfolio optimization process. This method offers investors returns higher than had previously been thought possible, with no increase in risk. In essence, this method pools a group of investors with different risk-reward goals in a single efficient portfolio that preserves the group's average risk tolerance. The portfolio's overall return is then distributed to the investors on the basis of their preselected risk levels. Pooling each investor's risk and return goals in one combined portfolio results in higher returns for everyone, proving that in portfolio management, the whole does exceed the sum of its parts.</description><author>Schirripa, F.; Tecotzky, N.

F.
For global equity portfolios, a number of active currency management strategies have consistently dominated both unhedged and passively hedged strategies. The author shows that for portfolios broadly diversified across major equity markets (including the U.S., the U.K., France, Germany, and Japan), a single technically based active currency management strategy yielded the highest risk adjusted return in all rolling ten-year periods and in twenty-one of twenty-four rolling five-year periods during 1972-1999. Although equity managers may not be in the business of foreign exchange management, they should not be blind to significant currency trends that could be detrimental to portfolio performance. The author suggests some practical techniques to address these trends.</description><author>Reinert, T.

Closed-end investment funds tend to sell at a discount to the market value of their investment assets. The two primary measures of success are the returns earned by the fund's investors (before- and after-tax) and the extent of the fund's market value discount from the market value of the investment assets. It is frequently assumed that the smaller the discount, the more Likely it is that the market approves of management's performance. This article considers the implications to a fund's management of these two measures of success. While there are many different explanations for these discounts, the authors focus on two tax effects and the resulting paradox. One tax effect is the fund's unrealized capital gain and the implicit future tax liability associated with it. The second tax effect is the value discount a tax-aware potential investor requires if the fund will realize future capital gains in a finite time period more rapidly than the investor would realize with a direct investment.</description><author>Bierman, H.; Swaminathan, B.</author><pubDate>Sat, 01 Jan 2000 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Better risk management - The maximum expected compound return of discretionary wealth.</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Wilcox, J.

In this article the author shows how a single criterion, the maximization of expected compound return of discretionary wealth, can be used to improve risk management practices in a wide variety of applications. Applications include setting appropriate short-term risk tolerance, evaluating the impact of skewed and fat-tailed return distributions, and analyzing stop loss orders and portfolio insurance as well as better management of active managers. The author shows the impact of the failure of tracking error to account for the covariance between active policies and benchmark risk as well as the potential for deceptive information ratios. Finally, he shows how to convert momentum and value investor styles into option-equivalents that can then be assessed in terms of latent risk and impact on expected compound return. It becomes obvious that value investing is like selling a put and a call.</description><author>Wilcox, J.

Using the universe of the 200 largest corporate pension plans in 1998, the authors report their value at risk (VaR) estimates and perform peer group comparisons on the basis of sector, plan assets, funding status, asset allocation, and performance. The results indicate that VaR estimates differ significantly for this sample, ranging fi om about 10% to 28%, with a median value of 17%. Also, plan aggressiveness increases more with plan assets than with funding status. More surprising is the finding that plan performance (i.e., actual plan returns) is not related. Although risk profiles differ across sectors, plans in the Healthcare, Technology, and Transportation sectors are the most aggressive (and risk profiles within sectors are closely aligned). The exceptions are Financials, Capital Goods, and Basic Materials.</description><author>Gupta, F.; Stubbs, E.; Thambiah, Y.</author><pubDate>Sat, 01 Jan 2000 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Sustainable investment withdrawals - The focus is on sustainability.</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Pye, G.

The mean-variance approach permits the evaluation of portfolio strategies without otherwise first specifying preferences about risk. It is not well suited, however, to investors who must make periodic withdrawals from their investments. This includes endowment funds, foundations, and individuals after they retire. Expected utility models have been applied to such situations, but they have been difficult for practitioners to implement since preferences must be specified beforehand. By assuming such investors want to make sustainable withdrawals, the author develops a simple model for evaluating investment choices over time without making any further assumptions about preferences. Various factors that affect the size and sustainability of the withdrawals are explored.</description><author>Pye, G.

This article examines the performance of large equity mutual funds over the past ten, fifteen, and twenty years. On both a before- and after-tax basis, the authors find that the average mutual fund underperformed the Vanguard Index 500 fund. Although part of this underperformance is attributed to a small-size bias inherent in active management, an analysis of the pure tax effects also shows that funds have not been managed in a tax-efficient manner.

J.; Goetzmann, W. N.; Park, J. M.
The authors test the performance of a number of global hedge funds over a four-year period in order to determine whether they could have been responsible for the crash in the Asian currencies in 1997. They use Sharpe's style analysis to measure the variations in the historical exposure of these funds to Asian currencies leading up to the crisis. The results indicate that fund profits were not generally positive during the crisis, nor were funds' estimated exposures to Asian currencies unusual. Consequently the authors find no empirical evidence to support the hypothesis that George Sores, or any other hedge fund manager, was responsible for the crisis. Style analysis suggests that global managers actively vary their exposures to currencies, but over the period 1993 through 1997 these fluctuations were not found to be associated with moves in exchange rates.</description><author>Brown, S.

Exploitable seasonal patterns in high-yield bond returns are not limited to the widely studied "January effect." On average, the high-yield sector outperforms ten-year Treasuries by a wider margin between December 1 and May 31 than between June 1 and November 30. Within the high-yield sector, single-Bs outperform double-Bs on average between December 1 and May 31, and underperform them between June 1 and November 30. The author finds that the semiannual seasonality effect does not appear to reflect seasonality in capital flows to the high-yield sector, but arises rather from a seasonal pattern in Treasury bond returns.</description><author>Fridson, M.
