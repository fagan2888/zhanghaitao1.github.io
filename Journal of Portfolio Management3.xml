Existing studies on market seasonality and the size effect are largely based on realized returns. In this article, Chen and Jindra investigate seasonal variations and size-related differences in a cross-stock valuation distribution. They use three stock valuation measures, two derived from structural models and one from the book-to-market ratio. The authors find that the average valuation level is highest in mid-summer and lowest in mid-December. Furthermore, the valuation dispersion (kurtosis) across stocks increases toward year-end and reverses direction after the turn of the year, suggesting increased movements in both the underand overvaluation directions. Among size groups, small-cap stocks exhibit the sharpest decline in valuation from June to December and the highest rise from December to January. For most months, small-cap stocks have the lowest valuation among all size groups and show the widest cross-stock valuation dispersion, meaning that they are also the hardest to value. Overall, large-cap stocks enjoy the highest valuation uniformity and are the least subject to valuation seasonality.</description><author>Chen, Zhiwu; Jindra, Jan</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jan 2010 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Finding Fair Value in Global Equities: Part II-Forecasting Returns</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Daly, Kevin; Nielsen, Anders Ersbak Bang; Oppenheimer, Peter
This article is the second of a two-part series that develops a framework for comparative valuation of major equity markets around the world. In this article, the authors invert the dividend discount model (DDM) discussed in "Fair Value in Global Equities: Part I," published in the preceding issue of this journal, in order to extract a time series of the implied equity risk premium (ERP) and the real required return (RRR). They estimate regression equations to find the macroeconomic drivers of these series. The ERP increases with the output gap at home and abroad, as well as with high past values of the ERP. This relationship allows for benchmarking the ERP and the RRR to the current economic environment and to forecasts of the future economic environment. The authors compare the use of these tools with other ways to forecast returns. At a five-year horizon, valuation alone is a good predictor of future returns, and the current value of the RRR works particularly well in this regard. At a one-year horizon, forecasts based on the benchmarking of the RRR to the future economic environment work significantly better than traditional valuation metrics, if the economic outlook is correct.</description><author>Daly, Kevin; Nielsen, Anders Ersbak Bang; Oppenheimer, Peter</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jan 2010 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Accentuated Intraday Stock Price Volatility: What Is the Cause?</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Ozenbas, Deniz; Pagano, Michael S.; Schwartz, Robert A.
In equity markets, the opening and closing of trading are particularly stressful periods. Ozenbas, Pagano, and Schwartz investigate the quality of price determination at these times (compared to midday periods) for large-, mid-, and smallcapitalization stocks on the NYSE, NASDAQ, and London Stock Exchange. Using three different metrics, they consistently find lower quality at both the open and the close. The deterioration of market quality at openings is greatest for large- cap stocks, but no systematic association with cap size is observed at the close. Large-cap stocks evidently lead smaller-cap stocks in finding new equilibrium values, and accentuated volatility at the open is in large part attributable to the complexities of price discovery.</description><author>Ozenbas, Deniz; Pagano, Michael S.; Schwartz, Robert A.</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jan 2010 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Risk Management Lessons Worth Remembering from the Credit Crisis of 2007-2009</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Golub, Bennett W.; Crum, Conan C.
This article by Golub and Crum presents six important lessons worth remembering from the credit crisis of 2007-2009. The recent credit crisis revealed the inadequacy of many standard methods in quantitative risk management and called into question the general efficiency of markets. Golub and Crum's analysis of the six lessons learned provides insights into what went wrong and offers advice on steps that institutions can take to avoid similar failures in the future. The authors present detailed analysis on risk management issues relating to liquidity, securitized products, certification, market risk, and policy risk.</description><author>Golub, Bennett W.; Crum, Conan C.</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jan 2010 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Crisis and Innovation</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Shiller, Robert J.
In this article, Shiller articulates the need for innovationenhancing regulation, not regulation that arbitrarily ties markets down. In the several years since the crisis began in 2007, only the first couple of stages of crisis response have been experienced. Other stages are expected. The next stage will be one in which the markets are made fundamentally more resilient and less prone to crisis. The final stage of response will be one in which the scope and depth of financial markets are expanded in order to move closer to completing the fundamental task of risk management, broadly construed. Together, all of these stages of response might take 10 years or longer.</description><author>Shiller, Robert J.</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jan 2010 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Survival of the Richest</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Lo, Andrew W.

Do stocks of admired companies yield admirable returns? Are increases in admiration followed by high stock returns, and how reliable is the relation between admiration and returns? These questions are answered by Anginer and Statman based on their study of Fortune magazine's annual list "America's Most Admired Companies." They find that from April 1983 through December 2007 stocks of admired companies had lower returns, on average, than stocks of spurned companies and that increases in admiration were followed, on average, by lower returns. The authors also find that the dispersion of returns is high, especially in the portfolio of spurned company stocks, implying that investors who would like to benefit from the return advantage of spurned company stocks must diversify widely among them.</description><author>Anginer, Deniz; Statman, Meir</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jan 2010 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Do Seasonal Anomalies Still Work?</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Dzhabarov, Constantine; Ziemba, William T.
Dzhabarov and Ziemba investigate whether traditional seasonal anomalies, such as the January effect, monthly effect, January barometer, sell-in-May-and-go-away phenomenon, holiday effect, and turn-of-the-month effect, still exist in the turbulent markets of the early part of the 21st century. The evidence indicates that there is still value in these anomalies. In their study, the authors use futures data from 1993 to 2009 and from 2004 to 2009 for small-cap stocks measured by the Russell 2000 Index and for large-cap stocks measured by the S&amp;P 500 Index. As was true in the 1990s, the effects tend to be stronger in small-cap stocks. The results are useful for investors who wish to tilt portfolios and for speculators who wish to trade the effects.</description><author>Dzhabarov, Constantine; Ziemba, William T.</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jan 2010 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Volatility Exposure for Strategic Asset Allocation</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Briere, Marie; Burgues, Alexandre; Signori, Ombretta
Briere, Burgues, and Signori examine the advantages of incorporating strategic exposure to equity volatility into the investment opportunity set of a long-term equity investor. They consider two standard volatility investments: implied volatility and volatility risk premium strategies. An analytical framework, which offers pragmatic solutions for longterm investors who seek exposure to volatility, is used to calibrate and assess the risk-return profiles of portfolios. The benefit of volatility exposure for a conventional portfolio is shown through a mean-modified Value at Risk portfolio optimization. A pure volatility investment makes it possible to partially hedge downside equity risk and thus reduce the risk profile of a portfolio, while an investment in the volatility risk premium substantially increases returns for a given level of risk. A well-calibrated combination of the two strategies enhances both the absolute and risk-adjusted returns of a portfolio.</description><author>Briere, Marie; Burgues, Alexandre; Signori, Ombretta</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jan 2010 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>A Bond-Picking Model for Corporate Bond Allocation</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>L'Hoir, Mathieu; Boulhabel, Mustafa
An active investment process in corporate bonds requires an approach that explicitly takes into account the diversification benefits that can be derived from a combination of alpha signals. The main challenge is to find indicators that fulfill at least two conditions. First, each individual alpha signal should achieve consistent performance on a univariate basis, and second, each should exhibit relatively low performance correlation because low correlation is a necessary condition for generating a diversification effect. L'Hoir and Boulhabel show that the combination of three types of signals-valuation signals, equity return signals, and earning momentum signals-fulfills the aforementioned conditions and delivers consistent and stable risk-adjusted returns. The authors present the results of their study for the U. K. corporate bond market.</description><author>L'Hoir, Mathieu; Boulhabel, Mustafa</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jan 2010 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Valuation-Indifferent Weighting for Bonds</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Arnott, Robert D.; Hsu, Jason C.; Li, Feifei; Shepherd, Shane D.
In historical testing, valuation-indifferent weighting applied to U. S. and global equities has produced statistically significant and economically large outperformance when compared with traditional capitalization-weighted benchmarks. In this article, the authors apply valuation-indifferent weighting to U. S. investment-grade corporate bonds, U. S. high-yield bonds, and hard-currency emerging market bonds. They find that fixed-income portfolios constructed using valuation-indifferent weighting outperform their corresponding cap-weighted benchmarks. The authors also find that the outperformance is higher for markets in which more inefficiencies and greater volatilities would be expected to occur.

For decades, the standard deviation of investment returns and beta have been the dominant risk metrics and guideposts for building portfolios of risky assets, but these risk measures have provided little help in explaining the cross-asset and cross-market volatility experienced over the last two years. The most recent spate of selling-contagion arose largely as a result of fund flows across asset classes. These flows were related to the urgent and large need to reduce risk and leverage by those investors who found themselves on the brink of financial ruin as a result of losses incurred. The author explores a common source of tail risk-specifically, episodes of extreme liquidity scarcity associated with horizon uncertainty-as well as the correlation across the cash flow demands of market participants and the short-run constraints on market-making capital. Liquidity risk is often high after a long period of abundant liquidity driven by low fundamental volatility, rising economic growth, and returns with trending patterns. Long option positions provide a natural hedge for liquidity risk, generating profits and losses based on the underlying security's price movement without any need to trade as well as from the likely increased volatility premium.</description><author>Hill, Joanne M.</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2009 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Clairvoyant Value II: The Growth/Value Cycle</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Arnott, Robert D.; Li, Feifei; Sherrerd, Katrina F.
The concept of Clairvoyant Value, introduced by the authors in the Spring 2009 issue of this journal, facilitates exploration of how the market prices future growth expectations across securities and over time. The authors find both concurrent and predictive links between the intertemporal change in the Valuation Dispersion-the relative valuation gap between growth and value stocks-and the observed growth-value "cycle" in the market. On average, the dispersion is twice as wide as subsequent financial results would justify; that is, the market historically has overpaid for growth. The authors also show that a wide dispersion in valuation multiples has tended to precede periods of exceptional performance by value stocks relative to growth stocks. The total wealth effect of investing in a Clairvoyant Value portfolio provides value for a company's future business prospects, but perhaps a bit less so than might be surmised.</description><author>Arnott, Robert D.; Li, Feifei; Sherrerd, Katrina F.</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2009 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Understanding Two Remarkable Findings about Stock Yields and Growth</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Thomas, Jacob; Zhang, Frank
Two regularities regarding stock prices and expected inflation have received less attention than they deserve. First, earnings and dividend yields move with long-term expected inflation and risk-free rates. Second, analysts' forecasts of nominal growth, not real growth, vary little with expected inflation. These patterns are remarkable because financial economists predict exactly the opposite. One explanation for these contrary findings is that stock prices are too high (low) when inflation is low (high), because investors confuse nominal and real growth rates. The authors assert that investors are unlikely to be so systematically naive about expected inflation and argue that the contrary evidence is, in fact, consistent with a rational market. The key insight offered by the authors is that reported earnings include inflationary holding gains, which causes higher earnings yields when inflation is high (the first regularity) and, in turn, explains why forecasts of nominal growth need not vary with inflation (the second regularity).</description><author>Thomas, Jacob; Zhang, Frank</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2009 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Explaining Earnings Per Share Growth</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Bierman, Harold; Hass, Jerome E.
The authors examine the fundamental factors that determine earnings growth, including the role of share repurchase, and offer a simple method of calculating the expected long-term growth rate of earnings per share. Many factors can affect the sequence of earnings, and the ability to formulate earnings growth models helps analysts isolate the direct factors that are likely to impact future earnings and earnings growth. If the forecast of the growth rate of earnings per share with share repurchase is 0.15 and without share repurchase is 0.10, the analyst knows that 0.05 of the 0.15 growth rate results from the share repurchase. The actual growth rate may, in fact, be different, in which case the analyst can recompute the actual growth rates with and without the share repurchase.</description><author>Bierman, Harold; Hass, Jerome E.</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2009 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Share Repurchases and Stock Valuation Models</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Stowe, John D.; McLeavey, Dennis W.; Pinto, Jerald E.
Share repurchases have grown rapidly in recent years and have exceeded total cash dividends since 1997. Some analysts argue that incorporating repurchases into a discounted cash flow framework leads to higher equity valuations and higher expected return estimates and, further, that traditional dividend discount models (DDMs) are obsolete. The authors disagree and demonstrate that the objection to the DDM is based on a logical error of not accurately accounting for the effect of share repurchases on investors' future cash flows. The authors compare a traditional DDM and a correctly specified discounted total cash flow model (TCFM) to show that the valuations and rates of return are the same with both a constant-growth-type model and a more general model. Importantly, a TCFM can be used instead of, or in addition to, a DDM, and the selection of model can be based on the quality of the information applicable to a particular situation.</description><author>Stowe, John D.; McLeavey, Dennis W.; Pinto, Jerald E.</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2009 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Taming Global Village Risk II: Understanding and Mitigating Bubbles</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Sullivan, Rodney N.
Asset bubbles and their subsequent bursts have been a part of capital markets since modern capital markets began to evolve some 300 years ago. Although each bubble environment has its own distinguishing characteristics, certain common elements persist over time as the key ingredients of market bubbles-financial innovation, the emotions and psychology of investors, and leverage. The author explores how these features present themselves in market bubbles and the ensuing market disruptions, and offers some suggestions for improving future risk management. Among the recommendations is a strong, yet flexible, oversight framework having the goal of identifying and containing areas of excessive economic risk.</description><author>Sullivan, Rodney N.</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2009 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>An Asset-Liability Version of the Capital Asset Pricing Model with a Multi-Period Two-Fund Theorem</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Waring, M. Barton; Whitney, Duane
Despite the simplicity of its strategic asset allocation policy prescription, the original Two-Fund Theorem has never been used by practitioners. The authors present a new capital asset pricing model (CAPM) that incorporates investors' deferred spending plans, or "economic liabilities"-the underlying purpose behind A investments-and thus reveal a new risk-free asset, the investor's liability-matching asset portfolio. In combination with a slightly redefined world market portfolio of risky assets, the authors' model forms a new two-fund theorem that is sensible, practical, and usable. The revised theorem provides an accessible and tractable form of an intertemporal CAPM, bridging the large gap between the simplistic single-period CAPM of Sharpe and others and the difficult, complex intertemporal models of Merton and others.</description><author>Waring, M.

Recent increases in inflation uncertainty have increased investor awareness of the need to hedge against unexpected changes in price levels. Given that the capacity of the inflation-linked securities market is not sufficient to meet the collective demand of institutional and private investors and that the OTC inflation derivatives market suffers from a perceived increase in counterparty risk, investors are now turning to other asset classes to seek inflation protection. Using a vector error correction model that explicitly distinguishes between short-term and long-term dynamics in the joint distribution of asset returns and inflation, the authors show that real estate and commodities have particularly attractive inflation-hedging properties over long horizons and that these properties justify the introduction of these asset classes into pension fund liability-hedging portfolios. These results suggest that novel forms of liability-driven investment solutions, including commodities and real estate in addition to inflation-linked securities, can be designed to decrease the cost of inflation insurance for long-horizon investors.</description><author>Amenc, Noel; Martellini, Uonel; Ziemann, Volker</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2009 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Risk-Profiling Defined Benefit Pension Schemes</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Dempster, Michael A. H.; Germano, Matteo; Medova, Elena A.; Murphy, James K.; Ryan, Dermot; Sandrini, Francesco
A dynamic stochastic optimization model of strategic assetliability management is useful in advising underfunded defined benefit pension schemes on best practice for returning to solvency and long-term stability. The authors present an overview of the dynamic stochastic programming techniques involved and briefly describe the nature of Pioneer Investment's proprietary CASM simulator from which the asset class returns and pension scheme liabilities are generated. The stochastic optimization model is described precisely in the article as well as its solution using linear programming. To illustrate the approach, the authors offer two examples of defined benefit schemes using simple, conservative, fund liability models. The optimal dynamic asset allocations of the two examples reflect the motivation of second generation liability-driven investment schemes. Although the final salary scheme models are simple, more complex models can be incorporated with little extra effort into the system described by the authors. Most actuarial assessments used in practice can be modeled for this purpose.</description><author>Dempster, Michael A.

An important question often faced by global portfolio managers is how to efficiently allocate a turnover budget across multiple markets that demonstrate different market characteristics and alpha model efficacies. Extending a dynamic model to a multi-market context, the author is able to provide several key insights for guiding practice. The author finds that in equilibrium more of the turnover budget should be allocated to markets in which 1) the alpha model produces higher information ratios, 2) new information arrives more rapidly, or 3) it is less expensive to trade. Optimal turnover, however, is rather insensitive to the aversion to risk in a given market. The author's findings are derived within a cross-sectional framework, but this does not preclude their application in a multi-period turnover allocation problem.</description><author>Yin, Hao</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2009 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Portfolio Risk Consequences of Fixed-Income Exposures</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Warren, Geoff
Interest rate and credit exposures can have quite different consequences for risk when viewed from a total portfolio perspective and from the perspective of a fixed-income portfolio in isolation. Within a fixed-income portfolio, interest rate exposure enhances volatility, whereas credit exposure can play a diversifying role. Conversely, at the total portfolio level, credit exposure tends to augment risk, While interest rate exposure may impact only modestly, or possibly even reduce, overall portfolio volatility. This dichotomy can give rise to agency problems when management of fixed-income portfolios is delegated. The author suggests various approaches for designing fixed-income mandates to better align them with investor objectives.</description><author>Warren, Geoff</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2009 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Return-Risk Ratios Under Taxation</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Leibowitz, Martin L.; Bova, Anthony
Intuition implies that taxes always detract from investment returns, which is, of course, true, but intuition tells us nothing about how an investor's return-risk balance might be altered by taxation. The authors address the issue by drawing upon a simple two-asset model composed of cash and a single equity asset, with the latter subject to an advantageous capital gains tax rate. It turns out that even though the taxed investor receives a lower net return, a differential tax structure can lead to return-risk ratios that are actually greater than their tax-free counterparts. Over short-term horizons, given standard assumptions, the taxed investor's return-risk advantages are not sufficient to provide high probabilities for achieving positive spreads over the risk-free rate. To capture such excess returns with an acceptable probability, investors-taxed or not-must move to significant equity positions, plan on five-year or longer horizons, or assume the presence of higher-than-standard equity return premiums.</description><author>Leibowitz, Martin L.; Bova, Anthony</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2009 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Where Have Thirty Years Gone?

The authors compare the price of a stock at a given point in time with its ex post realized value, which is defined by the discounted net present value of subsequent actual cash distributions. This measure is called the Clairvoyant Value, that is, the value that a clairvoyant investor with perfect foresight would have placed on the company. Using a stock's Clairvoyant Value, the authors tease out surprising results relating to the extent to which the market has correctly anticipated various future growth rates and to which investors have paid up for future growth expectations. These findings provide additional historical evidence on market efficiency and the value effect in the U. S. stock market. The authors conclude that although growth stocks (i.e., those trading at high multiples) do historically exhibit superior future growth-the market overpays for superior growth expectations with statistical significance.</description><author>Arnott, Robert D.; Li, Feifei; Sherrerd, Katrina F.</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2009 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Five Principles to Hold Onto (Even When Your Boss Says the Opposite)</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Siegel, Laurence B.; Waring, M.

Although finance practitioners almost universally learn in school that the Sharpe market model, which separates all returns into alpha and beta, is the starting point for a number of key investment insights, they often forget, or disregard, this knowledge once they are on the job. The five most important insights that a practitioner should hold dear, regardless of what the boss says, are 1) the importance of making alpha and beta decisions separately; 2) the zero-sum nature of active management; 3) the different criteria needed to make alpha and beta decisions; 4) the great value of alpha successfully delivered; and 5) the desirability of paying appropriate fees for each return component or, in other words, high fees for alpha, low fees for beta.</description><author>Siegel, Laurence B.; Waring, M.

After studying the impact of fund size and fund flows on the subsequent performance of funds of hedge funds, the authors find that funds with more assets tend to produce higher returns at lower levels of volatility, resulting in superior risk-adjusted performance. Across the majority of the size spectrum, a positive concave relationship exists between fund asset size and performance, while a negative correlation relationship exists between asset size and standard deviation. The smallest 25% of funds of funds underperformed the largest 75% of funds of funds by more than 2% annually from January 1995 to November 2006. This performance differential arises because a higher portion of the smallest funds deliver lower alpha, causing them to subsequently fail. Past good performers attract new inflows, but strong inflows adversely affect the subsequent performance of previously top-performing funds. In contrast, the top-performing and largest funds with below average asset flows perform significantly better than top funds with above average flows</description><author>Xiong, James; Idzorek, Thomas; Chen, Peng; Ibbotson, Roger</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2009 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Effect of Non-Normality Dynamics on the Expected Return of Options</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Figelman, Ilya
The author shows that, somewhat surprisingly, the real-world expected value of an at-the-money call option does not increase when stock index returns are assumed to follow a more realistic process that than of geometric Brownian motion. Thus, the fact that instantaneous stock returns are not normally distributed does not detract from the efficacy of covered call (CC) strategies (relative to the stock index), which employ at-the-money call options. The analysis presented in this article concentrates on the efficacy of stock index CC strategies. The stock index process used by the author incorporates stochastic volatility, jumps in returns, and jumps in volatility.</description><author>Figelman, Ilya</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2009 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Return Dynamics of Distressed Bonds</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Sterling, Karen; Fridson, Martin; Kong, Vince C.

This study adds to the small, but growing, body of research on active management of distressed debt. The analysis stratifies the distressed debt universe in various ways to test whether certain subgroups exhibit comparatively low risk or comparatively high returns, thereby representing superior investment opportunities. A small group of distressed bonds rated double-B do provide statistically lower default rates and higher bear market returns than single-B or triple-C issues. The authors also find no comparable advantages for bonds issued by public companies over bonds issued by private companies, which challenges the prevailing investor preference for public companies.

The authors investigate properties of synthetic fixed-income portfolios created by "recombining" a synthetic beta exposure with several hedge fund-based alpha sources. The recombination strategy has a risk/return profile superior to that of traditional long-only managers. But in order to implement the synthetic strategy, investors must pick fund managers. Manager selection risk is substantially greater in synthetic fixed-income portfolios compared to long-only ones, and incorporating this ex ante manager selection risk reduces the appeal of synthetic fixed income. Adequate diversification of this risk requires investing in at least five different hedge funds, which may increase the strategy's costs and diminish its attractiveness.

Investors with small portfolios, or a limited number of securities in their portfolios, may benefit from a new portfolio optimization method. Placing a limit on the number of assets in a portfolio turns the ordinary mean-variance portfolio optimization problem into a challenging puzzle, especially for larger investment universes. In response, practitioners typically employ either enumerative methods, such as branch-and-bound based on quadratic programming relaxation, or heuristic methods. Both approaches have their respective disadvantages in that quadratic programming-based branch-and-bound may fail to solve large problems in reasonable time and heuristics may produce solutions of unknown quality. The new method presented by the authors can be used to solve smaller problems to optimality. For larger problems, the method produces good heuristic solutions along with a useful estimate of their quality; that is, the distance from the optimum. The computational results are promising.</description><author>Kopman, Leonid; Liu, Shucheng Scott; Shaw, Dong</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2009 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>\ Markowitz Versus the Talmudic Portfolio Diversification Strategies</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Duchin, Ran; Levy, Haim
Although expected utility theory and the classical mean-variance diversification theory of Markowitz assert that optimal diversification depends on the joint distribution of returns, investors tend to ignore these well-accepted theoretical approaches in favor of the naive investment strategy promulgated in the Babylonian Talmud called the 1/3 rule (or the 1/n rule for n assets), which assigns an equal weight to each security in the portfolio. In testing the efficiency of the 1/n rule, the authors find that it outperforms the mean-variance rule for individual small portfolios out of sample, but for large portfolios (i.e., institutional investors) the Markowitz strategy is superior. The advantage of the 1/n rule in the out-of-sample analysis is the absence of exposures to estimation errors.</description><author>Duchin, Ran; Levy, Haim</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2009 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>The Black-Litterman Model for Active Portfolio Management</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Da Silva, Alexandre S.; Lee, Wai; Pornrojnangkool, Bobby
Portfolio optimization presents a challenge to investors through the tendency of small differences in expected return inputs to create major swings in portfolio weightings, sometimes leading to extreme portfolio allocations. The authors believe that the Black-Litterman (BL) model can play a highly constructive role in alleviating this problem for investors, because the model combines active investment views and equilibrium views through a Bayesian approach. So that investors can fully exploit this important investment model, the authors discuss the development of the BL model within the mean-variance portfolio efficiency paradigm, examine the phenomenon of unintentional trades and additional risks related to the traditional implementation of BL in active portfolio management, and propose a potential remedy that leads to portable alpha implementation of active portfolios.</description><author>Da Silva, Alexandre S.; Lee, Wai; Pornrojnangkool, Bobby</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2009 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Investing in Global Equities: An Alternative Approach to Structuring Equity Portfolios</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Lin, Wenling; Hoffman, Phil; Duncan, Ann
Hiring the right manager is crucial in capturing the alpha potential of a fully global approach to equity investing. Since 1999, global equity managers, as a whole, have outperformed a combination of U. S. and non-U. S. managers, although evidence of outperformance is weaker over the longer term. Only 21% of these global managers have actually added value through their allocations to U. S. and non-U. S. stocks.

Not all value strategies are created equal; that is, correlations among different value strategies and among similar value strategies across markets are, in general, low. Thus, to preserve market neutrality and reduce exposure to volatility, investors need to augment value strategies and adopt a multi-strategy approach. Some exposures, however, are common to value strategies and are not diversified away. Among these exposures are value premiums and volatility jumps. The authors present their findings of value-based strategies in several markets, including top-down country allocation in equities, bonds, and currencies, and bottom-up stock selection in the U. S., Japan, and Germany. The focus of the authors' research is on the correlations among these strategies and their exposures to select market factors.</description><author>Qian, Edward; Sorensen, Eric H.; Hua, Ronald</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2009 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>The Opportunity Set: Market Opportunities and the Effective Breadth of a Portfolio</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Grinold, Richard C.; Taylor, Mark P.
The opportunity set (OS) is an ex post measure of the maximum Sharpe ratio for a given universe of assets. As the authors show, the average value of the OS is approximately equal to the square root of portfolio breadth, or the number of assets in a portfolio. The authors thus suggest an interpretation of the OS to be the effective breadth of a portfolio. Effective breadth is higher when the volatility of asset returns is high because such an environment offers investors more opportunities for generating returns, which is tantamount to having greater portfolio breadth. When asset return volatility is lower, the opposite is true; that is, effective breadth is lower and investors are hard-pressed to generate excess returns at any risk level.</description><author>Grinold, Richard C.; Taylor, Mark P.</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2009 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Micro versus Macro in a Disorderly World</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Bernstein, Peter L.

In an effort to determine the number and economic power of individuals who have the ability to use institutional-quality real estate, the authors develop a methodology to estimate the size of the middle class and its economic productivity in developing countries. The authors' model employs a long-tailed Pareto distribution to estimate the dispersion of wealth and productivity in each country included in the study-Brazil, China, India, Mexico, Russia, and Turkey. The model uses readily available secondary data, namely, GDP per capita and the Gini coefficient, in conjunction with a user-defined global threshold income level to define middle class. The methodology is general enough to be applied to any developing country and any threshold definition.</description><author>Kapas, Manidipa; Liang, Youguo</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Sep 2009 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>The Real Estate Risk Premium: A Developed/Emerging Country Panel Data Analysis</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>D'Argensio, John-John; Laurin, Frederic
In this article, the authors present a study of the country risk premium in the office real estate market. The authors identify the determinants of office capitalization rates across a panel of 52 emerging and developed countries between 2000 and 2006. The capitalization rate should be proportional to the perception of a country's risk, as measured by the country's government bond yields. Based on this assumption, the authors estimate an intertemporal country-specific real estate risk premium. In consideration of endogeneity, the authors also estimate a model to explain the 10-year government bond yield, which produces additional information on country risk assessment. The authors find that government bond yields are the main determinant of the capitalization rate. Real estate variables also play a role, but to a lesser extent.</description><author>D'Argensio, John-John; Laurin, Frederic</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Sep 2009 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Style Analysis in Real Estate Markets: Beyond the Sector and Region Dichotomy</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Fuerst, Franz; Marcato, Gianluca
Although returns-based style analysis has been studied extensively in equity markets, applications of this valuable tool for measuring and benchmarking performance and risk in a real estate context are still relatively new. Previous studies in the real estate market have identified three investment categories: sectors, administrative regions, and economic regions. The low explanatory power of this type of categorization, however, reveals the need to extend returns-based analysis within a real estate context. First, the authors review the obstacles to transferring equity style analysis to real estate. Then, they apply a multivariate model to randomly generated portfolios to test the significance of four real estate investment styles in explaining portfolio returns for various types of properties-small versus big, high yield versus low yield, concentrated versus diversified, and short lease versus long lease. Results show that alpha performance is significantly reduced when the new investment styles are accounted for; the small versus big property style is dominant. In addition, the authors find that the probability of obtaining alpha performance is dependent upon the actual exposure of funds to style factors and that both alpha and systematic risk levels are linked to the actual characteristics of portfolios. Overall, the authors' results suggest that fund managers should use one of the four (and possibly other) style factors to set benchmarks and to analyze portfolio returns.</description><author>Fuerst, Franz; Marcato, Gianluca</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Sep 2009 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Hedging Real Estate Risk</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Fabozzi, Frank J.; Shiller, Robert J.; Tunaru, Radu S.

Using REIT return data, bond data, and property holding data, the authors construct property market segment-specific indices of asset returns. The authors show that these pure-play indices can be employed to make pure, targeted investments in the commercial real estate market while retaining the liquidity, transparency, and pricing efficiency benefits of the well-developed public market in REITs. These pure-play indices compare favorably with existing property market return indices, displaying volatilities similar to transaction-based indices, such as the Moody's/REAL Commercial Property Price Index, but tending to lead the private market in time. The pure-play indices can be generated at a daily frequency without significant noise and at various levels of market segment granularity and, notably, have led the transactions-based direct property market indices during the recent market downturn. The authors' findings suggest that the REIT-based pure-play indices may provide a unique, new information source about the commercial property market, as well as a unique capability to facilitate targeted investments, construct hedges, and potentially support derivatives trading.</description><author>Horrigan, Holly; Case, Brad; Geltner, David; Pollakowski, Henry</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Sep 2009 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Commercial Mortgage Default and Refinancing Risk: A Primer</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Corcoran, Patrick J.
In the period 1993-2006, commercial mortgages and commercial mortgage-backed securities provided highly competitive returns, on a risk-adjusted basis, relative to other investments in the stock and bond universe. The severe 2007-2009 financial market meltdown, induced by the downturn in the housing bubble, provides a stiff challenge to the continuation of previously strong results. Corcoran examines historical performance of commercial mortgage defaults and seeks to draw inferences about defaults in the unusual 2007-2009 U.S. economic downturn.

In this article, the authors revisit many studies that have attempted to explain the determinants of real estate capitalization rates. Two new innovations are introduced. First, the authors identify two macroeconomic factors, in addition to risk-free Treasury rates, that greatly impact cap rates-the general corporate risk premium operating in the economy and the amount of debt (liquidity) available. The addition of these factors greatly adds to the ability of previous models to explain the secular fall of cap rates in the last decade and their recent rise. Second, the authors search for "structural" shifts in the cap rate using innovative tests, including a large number of macroeconomic factors. The tests identify two distinct periods that the authors label as "investor sentiment." A period of negative sentiment was identified from 1991 to 1996 and a period of positive sentiment was identified from 2002 to 2007. Methodologically, the analysis uses a large and robust quarterly panel dataset of 30 U.S. metropolitan areas from 1980 Q1 through 2007 Q4. The authors compare the models using traditional measures of within-sample fit, as well as how the models behave in in-sample backtest forecasts.</description><author>Chervachidze, Serguei; Costello, James; Wheaton, William</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Sep 2009 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Capital Markets Impact on Commercial Real Estate Cap Rates: A Practitioner's View</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Peyton, Martha S.
The capital markets turmoil that exploded credit spreads in mid-2007 had no discernible impact on commercial real estate pricing until a year later when capitalization rates associated with NCREIF-NPI property sales began to widen from all time lows. The model developed in this article identifies "signal variables" that could have been used to inform commercial real estate investor expectations in the interim. The model's results demonstrate that over short periods of time, cap rates can be predicted by macroeconomic and financial market conditions combined with commercial real estate market fundamentals.

On the one hand, urban economics suggests that commercial real estate and owner-occupied housing are driven by common fundamentals, which should make them perform similarly. On the other hand, stronger limits to arbitrage in housing suggest that wider swings in prices, which are unrelated to fundamentals, are feasible in that property sector. And wider swings in fundamentals could be expected in the commercial sector due to the longer lead times for commercial buildings to be permitted and delivered, leading to a greater possibility of a temporal mismatch between supply and demand. Yet, the author finds many more similarities than differences across the two real estate sectors. The simple correlation between appreciation rates on owner-occupied housing and commercial real estate is between 40% and 60%, depending on the data source. Both sectors also exhibit similar time-series patterns in their price appreciation, with persistence across individual years and mean reversion over longer periods. In this article, Gyourko explores the various linkages between these two huge sectors, including the cost of land and materials, cost of capital, lender optimism, and access to the productivity and amenities of a given labor market area. With the recent dramatic declines in house prices, the strong similarities between the two sectors are foreboding given that the commercial real estate capital structure looks weak and a strong mean-reversion process in prices may still be underway.</description><author>Gyourko, Joseph</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Sep 2009 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Real Estate's Evolution as an Asset Class</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Clayton, Jim; Giliberto, S.

In this introductory article, the editors of this issue examine the impact of the credit crisis on commercial and multifamily real estate and provide a post-crisis, evolutionary view of real estate as an asset class. This is done by putting the events of the last 18 months into a broad perspective and within a framework that encompasses these major themes: 1) capital market integration, financial leverage, and sentiment; 2) the "failure" of diversification; 3) innovations in real estate portfolio risk measurement and management; and 4) international real estate. The aim of the article is to help investors understand the evolving characteristics of the asset class and to help them improve the effectiveness of actions that anticipate, monitor, and manage risk. It also sets the stage for the collection of articles in this issue that offer new insights into how commercial and multifamily real estate investing lines up with assumptions about market efficiency, outlier risks, theories of diversification, and longer-term asset and risk allocation.</description><author>Clayton, Jim; Giliberto, S.

I write at a time of financial and economic crisis in our nation and around the globe. I venture to assert that when the history of the financial era which has just drawn to a close comes to be written, most of its mistakes and its major faults will be ascribed to the failure to observe the fiduciary principle, the precept as old as holy writ, that 'a man cannot serve two masters.' No thinking man can believe that an economy built upon a business foundation can permanently endure without some loyalty to that principle. The separation of ownership from management, the development of the corporate structure so as to vest in small groups control over the resources of great numbers of small and uninformed investors, make imperative a fresh and active devotion to that principle if the modern world of business is to perform its proper function. Yet those who serve nominally as trustees, but relieved, by clever legal devices, from the obligation to protect those whose interests they purport to represent, corporate officers and directors who award to themselves huge bonuses from corporate funds without the assent or even the knowledge of their stockholders. financial institutions which, in the infinite variety of their operations, consider only last, if at all, the interests of those who funds they command, suggest how far we have ignored the necessary implications of that principle. The loss and suffering inflicted on individuals, the harm done to a social order founded upon business and dependent upon its integrity, are incalculable.</description><author>Bogle, John C.</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2009 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Risk is a Choice Rather Than a Fate</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Perold, Andre F.

Three prominent academic studies, all recently published, found that corporate bond investors have benefited from the post-trade transparency that has resulted from the reporting requirements mandated by the U. S. Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) Trade Reporting and Compliance Engine, or TRACE. The author argues that all three studies suffer from similar methodological shortcomings, such as confusing dealer mark-ups with commissions in measuring transactions costs and overlooking the far more relevant trading opportunity costs. And although TRACE may have facilitated price discovery, the author asserts that it is at the expense of quantity discovery and, thus, has incrementally decreased market liquidity. The SEC's implementation of TRACE was undoubtedly well intentioned, but it appears more harm than good was done to the investors it was meant to benefit.</description><author>Tempelman, Jerry H.</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2009 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Is There a Green Factor?</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Chia, Chin-Ping; Goldberg, Lisa R.; Owyong, David T.; Shepard, Peter; Stoyanov, Tsvetan
Climate change has far-reaching implications for the global economy and is increasingly being recognized by investors as a long-term investment theme. As more investors take note of companies that are well positioned to handle climate change, a common factor may account, in part, for the share prices of these companies. The authors search for the existence of this common factor, which they call the green equity factor. During the three-year period from May 2005 through May 2008, the authors find that a sample portfolio of renewable energy stocks outperformed the broad, global MSCI All Country World Index (ACWI), as well as a subindex consisting of traditional energy stocks. Their findings persist after adjusting for size, value, and country biases in the sample portfolio. Furthermore, a systematic analysis based on the Barra Global Equity Model supports the existence of a renewable energy risk factor.</description><author>Chia, Chin-Ping; Goldberg, Lisa R.; Owyong, David T.; Shepard, Peter; Stoyanov, Tsvetan</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2009 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Beyond the Central Tendency: Quantile Regression as a Tool in Quantitative Investing</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Gowlland, Chris; Xiao, Zhijie; Zeng, Qi
Quantitative investors frequently analyze factor performance using regression based on the familiar ordinary least squares approach. This is highly effective for understanding the central tendency within a dataset, but will often be less useful for assessing the behavior of datapoints close to the upper or lower extremes within a population. But from the perspective of active investors or risk managers, the datapoints at the extremes may be precisely the ones of greatest interest. For such applications, a more appropriate methodology is quantile regression. The authors show how quantile regression represents an extension of the conventional ordinary least squares method, and present an empirical analysis of factor effectiveness applied to a universe of U. S. small-cap stocks in order to illustrate the insights offered by this technique.</description><author>Gowlland, Chris; Xiao, Zhijie; Zeng, Qi</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2009 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Understanding the VIX</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Whaley, Robert E.

The author explains the VIX, its history and purpose, and explains its place within the array of indices that help describe where the economy stands relative to recent historical points of reference.</description><author>Whaley, Robert E.</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2009 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Social Capital in Financial Markets: Trust, but Verify</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Statman, Meir
The global crisis that unfolded in 2008, and is still front and center today, reminds us that the hidden hand of self interest does not assure economic welfare. Social capital in the form of fairness, trust, and cooperation must supplement self interest, and the government must supplement both self interest and social capital with laws and regulations. Some counties are richer in social capital than others and some governments are more vigorous in the enforcement of laws and regulations than others. The author assesses the social capital of eight countries by perceptions of the fairness of insider trading and discusses the implications within the context of the current crisis.</description><author>Statman, Meir</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2009 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Fund of Funds, Portable Alpha, and Portfolio Optimization</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Chen, Peng; Jiang, George J.; Zhu, Kevin X.
The authors examine the portfolio optimization problem that arises when a manager's mandate is a fund of funds with an asset allocation benchmark. The portfolio manager's objective is to maximize the portfolio excess return over the benchmark subject to given tracking errors. The authors decompose total tracking error into two components-the deviation from the benchmark and the additional risk factors associated with fund alpha. By quantifying the contribution of each component of portfolio excess return, the authors show that the performance of the style-constrained portfolio is determined by the active alpha-seeking skill of the portfolio manager and that fund alphas can be separated from their style loadings and are portable. These findings will not only help investors determine optimal tracking error constraints, but will also provide a framework for portfolio managers to identify funds with certain characteristics in order to achieve an optimal portfolio return.</description><author>Chen, Peng; Jiang, George J.; Zhu, Kevin X.</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2009 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Momentum Trading and Performance with Wrong Return Expectations</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Gatev, Evan; Ross, Stephen A.
Many long-term institutional investors use strategic portfolio allocation to maximize net asset value assuming that long-run expected returns are constant. This approach is complemented by tactical asset allocation when an asset class is perceived to offer higher expected returns in the short run. When investment performance is evaluated in the interim, it can be difficult to assess the merit of private beliefs about changing expected returns. The authors examine the annual expected return and dynamic trading under wrong assumptions about time-varying expected returns and show that a misspecified portfolio policy can outperform the correct policy. They also find that the particular assumptions about how expected returns vary through time can be identified from observed rebalancing of a portfolio. The assumption that expected returns are changing implies that momentum trading is optimal under certain conditions. In contrast, contrarian trading is always optimal when prices are assumed to follow a random walk around a constant long-term trend. These results can inform the annual performance evaluation of institutions, such as endowments, pension plans, mutual funds, and hedge funds that have long-term investment objectives.</description><author>Gatev, Evan; Ross, Stephen A.</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2009 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Portfolio Size Effect in Retirement Accounts: What Does It Imply for Lifecycle Asset Allocation Funds?</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Basu, Anup K.; Drew, Michael E.
Lifecycle funds offered by retirement plan providers allocate aggressively to risky asset classes when the employee participants are young, gradually switching to more conservative asset classes as they grow older and approach retirement. This approach focuses on maximizing growth of the accumulation fund in the initial years and preserving its value in the later years. The authors simulate terminal wealth outcomes based on conventional lifecycle asset allocation rules as well as on contrarian strategies that reverse the direction of asset switching. The evidence suggests that the growth in portfolio size over time significantly impacts the asset allocation decision. Due to the portfolio size effect that is observed by the authors, the terminal value of accumulation in retirement accounts is influenced more by the asset allocation strategy adopted in later years relative to that adopted in early years. By mechanistically switching to conservative assets in the later years of a plan, lifecycle strategies sacrifice significant growth opportunity and prove counterproductive to the participant's wealth accumulation objective. The authors' conclude that this sacrifice does not seem to be compensated adequately in terms of reducing the risk of potentially adverse outcomes.</description><author>Basu, Anup K.; Drew, Michael E.</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2009 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>On the Performance of Extended Alpha (130/30) versus Long-Only</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Tol, Ramon; Wanningen, Christiaan
Many have advanced the theoretical attractiveness of long-only extension products, more widely known as 130/30 strategies. In this article, the authors address the practical aspects of successfully implementing a 130/30 strategy based on an analysis of their unique database of actual manager performance for 130/30 versus long-only. The authors compare the returns of extension products with their long-only counterparts using a dataset of 73 product pairs from 53 managers, and find that 55% of the extension products have a higher information ratio than the corresponding long-only product. After testing for differences in the mean monthly alphas, the authors find that managers who deliver a higher information ratio in the 130/30 product also deliver mean monthly alphas in excess of the long-only product at a 5% significance level. Furthermore, the authors' analysis reveals that only 33% of the entire sample of managers adds value through shorting and only a small subset of managers is able to compensate for underperformance in short positions by outperforming in long positions while achieving a higher information ratio than the long-only counterpart product. The authors thus conclude that adding value in short positions is highly important in running a successful 130/30 strategy.</description><author>Tol, Ramon; Wanningen, Christiaan</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2009 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Long-Only: The Natural Benchmark Choice for 130/30</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Waid, Robert J.
Controversy surrounds the choice of a proper benchmark for short-extension investment strategies, such as a 130/30 strategy. Because these strategies are compared to hedge funds and have significant implementation differences compared to long-only strategies, peer groups or even a 130/30 index have been suggested as the appropriate benchmark. The author argues that a short-extension investment strategy is not a separate asset class and it competes for the same investment assets as a long-only strategy; thus, a short-extension investment strategy requires a long-only benchmark-rather than a unique benchmark-to measure manager skill.</description><author>Waid, Robert J.</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2009 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Diversification Performance and Stress-Betas</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Leibowitz, Martin L.; Bova, Anthony
In earlier research, the authors found that, on both a theoretical and historical basis, the typical diversified fund exhibits volatility characteristics that are strikingly similar to a traditional 60/40 allocation and, in severe market declines, should theoretically underperform the 60/40 portfolio. This latter and surprising result is due to the stress-beta effect that derives from diversification because the multiple asset classes are more vulnerable to correlation tightening than the two-asset 60/40 allocation. The year 2008 provided an (unwelcome) opportunity for the authors to test this stress effect. They found that in 2008 the diversified portfolio's correlation-based beta was, in fact, much higher than in normal times and that 2008 was the first period in which the diversified portfolio performed materially worse than the 60/40 portfolio. Thus, the typical model of institutional diversification should be viewed not as reducing risk in the short-term, but rather as a source of longer-term benefits in the form of greater return accumulation and wider divergence of outcomes.</description><author>Leibowitz, Martin L.; Bova, Anthony</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2009 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>More Social Security, Not Less</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Goetzmann, William N.

High allocations to alternative investments by investors, such as foundations and endowments, raise infrequently discussed concerns about liquidity. As the percentage of assets under management invested in alternatives rises, the availability of liquid equities and bonds available to meet spending requirements, capital calls, and margin calls plummets. A series of simulations shows how severe this problem can become in bear markets. The remedy for this problem is to ladder gradually into illiquid assets, so that expected future cash flows from these assets partially or fully offset capital calls and other cash requirements. New and enthusiastic investors in illiquid alternative investments sometimes forget this principle. By adhering to it, an alternatives program can be successful, but not on an unlimited scale. It is also necessary to hold a considerable portion of a portfolio in liquid stocks and bonds.</description><author>Siegel, Laurence B.</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2008 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Going Negative: What to Do with Negative Book Equity Stocks</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Brown, Stephen; Lajbcygier, Paul; Li, Bob
A firm's book equity is a measure of the value held by a firm's ordinary shareholders. Increasingly, it is being reported as a negative number. Because a firm's limited liability structure means that shareholders cannot have negative value, negative book equity has no obvious interpretation. Consequently, both practitioners and academics typically omit such stocks in their analysis. While these stocks are small in number, they are disproportionately represented in extreme growth? value sectors and, therefore, can have an impact on applications where value is defined in terms of book equity. The authors propose a new approach that classifies negative book equity stocks across the growth? value spectrum by considering how close their returns correspond to those of stocks that fit more obviously into these classifications. They find that this new value factor, which includes negative book equity stock, is economically and statistically different from the old value factor that excludes such stocks. Although they illustrate how this approach can be used to classify negative book equity stock, the approach is quite general and may be used whenever particular accounting data are unavailable or otherwise suspect.</description><author>Brown, Stephen; Lajbcygier, Paul; Li, Bob</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2008 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Sin Stock Returns</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Fabozzi, Frank J.; Ma, K.

Several likely reasons for the positive excess returns in sin stocks are identified. The authors argue that trustees or fiduciaries who develop institutional investment policy statements should fully understand the economic consequences of screening out stocks of companies that produce a product inconsistent with their value systems. In addition, institutional investors should question if the cost to uphold common social standards is worthwhile.</description><author>Fabozzi, Frank J.; Ma, K.

Along with the ongoing effort to build market cap? independent portfolios, the authors explore the properties of diversification as a driver of portfolio construction. They introduce a measure of the diversification of a portfolio that they term the diversification ratio. The measure is then employed to build a risk-efficient portfolio, or the Most-Diversified Portfolio. The theoretical properties of the resulting portfolios are discussed and compared to other popular methodologies, such as market-cap weights, equal weights, and minimum variance. The empirical results confirm that these popular methodologies are dominated by risk-efficient portfolios in many aspects. The implication is that in the long run, actively managed portfolios that maximize diversification are strong candidates for achieving consistently better results than commonly used passive index tracking methodologies. The message is clear? investors and their trustees cannot afford to ignore the benefits of maximal diversification.</description><author>Choueifaty, Yves; Coignard, Yves</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2008 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Global Tactical Cross-Asset Allocation: Applying Value and Momentum Across Asset Classes</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Blitz, David C.; Van Vliet, Pim
Global tactical asset allocation (GTAA) strategies across a broad range of asset classes are explored in this article. In contrast to market timing for single asset classes and tactical allocation across similar assets, this topic has received little attention in the existing literature. The main finding documented in this article is that momentum and value strategies applied to GTAA across 12 asset classes deliver statistically and economically significant abnormal returns. For a long top-quartile and short bottom-quartile portfolio based on a combination of momentum and value signals, the authors report a return of 12% per annum over the 1986? 2007 period. Performance is stable over time, is also present in an out-of-sample period, and is sufficiently high to overcome transaction costs in practice. The return cannot be explained by potential structural biases toward asset classes with high risk premiums, nor by the Fama? French and Carhart hedge factors. The authors argue that financial markets may be macroinefficient due to insufficient "smart money" being available to arbitrage away mispricing effects.</description><author>Blitz, David C.; Van Vliet, Pim</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2008 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>On the Fundamental Law of Active Portfolio Management: How to Make Conditional Investments Unconditionally Optimal</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Zhou, Guofu
The fundamental law of active portfolio management tells an active manager how to transform his alpha forecasts into the valued-added of his active portfolio by using a linear strategy with active positions proportional to the forecasts. This linear strategy is conditionally optimal because it is optimal each period, conditional on the forecasts at that time. The unconditional value-added? the valued-added over the long haul or over multiple periods? is what the manager normally strives to achieve. Under this unconditional objective, the linear strategy can approach zero value-added if the forecasts or signals have a high kurtosis. To overcome this problem, the author provides an investment strategy that maximizes the unconditional value-added with the optimal use of conditional information. The strategy is nonlinear in the forecasts, but has a simple economic interpretation. When the alpha forecasts are high, an active manager invests less aggressively than the linear strategy, and when the forecasts are low, an active manager invests more aggressively. In this way, an active manager tends to smooth out value-added over time and, hence, on a risk-adjusted basis, the active manager's long-term unconditional value-added will be substantially higher than the value-added based on a linear strategy, particularly when the alpha forecasts experience high kurtosis.</description><author>Zhou, Guofu</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2008 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>What Caused the Mess?</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Bernstein, Peter L.

Mutual fund managers are evaluated primarily on their ability to outperform their peers (rather than outperform a stated index), although managers have no ex ante information on investment decisions made by their competitors. A new approach for constructing benchmarks of peer managers uses return-based style analysis, deriving a peer group's exposures to a predetermined set of market factors from past performance using an optimization algorithm. The objective of the optimization is to find weights for factors that result in the best possible replication of the mutual fund returns. Understanding the aggregate exposures of a manager's peers (and the dispersion among them) allows managers to better assess the trade-off between the risk taken relative to their peers and the benefit expected (outperformance). The approach offers the advantages of more timely comparisons, the capacity to observe intraperiod shifts, and the ability to construct historical time series more readily than enabled by data on the actual holdings of mutual funds.</description><author>Ben Dor, Arik; Budinger, Vernon; Dynkin, Lev; Leech, Kenneth</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2008 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>The beta continuum: From classic beta to bulk beta</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Anson, Mark
In the terminology of portfolio management, alpha versus beta has become a common expression even though many investors view alpha and beta as two disparate points on an economic compass. The reality is that there are a continuum of returns from pure beta on the one hand to pure alpha at the other end of the scale. Along the way there are multiple investment products in stages on the beta versus alpha Scale. The beta continuum can represent the many ways that systematic risk premiums are packaged and delivered to investors. Examples demonstrate that beta is not a single data point but an ever-increasing effort to capture systematic risk premiums in new and innovative ways that, at the end of the continuum, begin to resemble active management.</description><author>Anson, Mark</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2008 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>The short side of 130/30 investing for the conservative portfolio manager</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Gastineau, Gary L.
Many long-only investment managers are looking for ways to offer 130/30 strategies and other "enhanced long strategies" or "constrained long-short portfolios." Conservative portfolio managers with little or no experience in short-selling can use sector evaluations from their firms' investment process to add alpha with short positions in exchange-traded funds (ETFs). While individual stock selection has the greatest potential to add value on the short side as well as on the long, differences in performance among various domestic sectors come in a close second. The dispersion in sector performance combined with some advantages of using ETFs to implement short sector positions makes sector ETFs to establish the short side of a 130/30 position a compelling choice for investment managers without fully integrated long-short stock port folios. Some sector ETFs are easy to trade, easy to borrow, and easy to integrate as the short side of a long-short portfolio.</description><author>Gastineau, Gary L.</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2008 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>130/300: The new long-only</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Lo, Andrew W.; Patel, Pankaj N.
Long-only portfolio managers and investors have acknowledged that the long-only constraint is a potentially costly drag on performance, and loosening this constraint can add value, but the extent of the performance drag is difficult to measure without a proper benchmark for a 130/30 portfolio. A passive but dynamic benchmark can be developed, consisting of a plain-vanilla 130/30 strategy using simple factors to rank stocks and standard methods for construction of portfolios based on these rankings. Two types of indexes are produced-investable and look-ahead indexes; the former uses only prior information, and the latter uses realized returns to set an upper bound on performance. Historical simulations of these 130/30 benchmarks illustrate their advantages and disadvantages under various market conditions.</description><author>Lo, Andrew W.; Patel, Pankaj N.</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2008 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Enhanced active equity portfolios are trim equitized long-short portfolios (vol 34, pg 22, 2007)</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Jacobs, Bruce I.; Levy, Kenneth N.

The asset allocation decision is arguably the most important decision in the investment process. It involves allocating an investor's portfolio among a set of desirable asset classes, but the investor must first define the asset classes to consider. The concept of investment-consumption value may help investors decide on including non-traditional asset classes such as hedge funds or commodities. The decision framework is grounded in the financial economics of the consumption CAPM and state/preference models. From this perspective, commodities are one example to consider as an investable asset class.</description><author>Sullivan, Rodney N.</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2008 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>CAPM investors do not get paid for bearing risk: A linear relation does not imply payment for risk</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Markowitz, Harry M.

In fact, this is not a correct interpretation, because two securities may have different excess returns even though they have identical risk structures in terms of their covariances with other securities in the market.

While the simple investment principles espoused 60 years ago by Benjamin Graham remain valid today, investment strategies have become far more active, as the financial sector has come to play a dominant role in our economy. Mutual funds have become less diversified; their portfolio turnover has risen sixfold; and investors now hold fund shares for dramatically shorter periods. Fund expense ratios have risen sharply, a manifestation of the soaring costs of the US. financial sector, estimated at $528 billion in 2007. Financial sector earnings have risen commensurately, to more than $200 billion, contributing as much as one-third of the aggregate profits of the S&amp;P 500. As gross return in the financial markets, minus the costs of intermediation, must equal the net return delivered to investors, such costs constitute a substantial drag on investor wealth. Yet both the profession and the academic community have largely ignored systemwide costs. It is high time for an in-depth study of the costs and benefits of our financial system, to ensure that it functions in the national public interest and in the interest of investors.</description><author>Bogle, John C.</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2008 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Disposition matters: Volume, volatility, and price impact of a behavioral bias</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Goetzmann, William N.; Massa, Massimo

A panel of individual investor trading records allows examination of the differences in price, volume, and volatility attributable to the disposition effect. When disposition-prone investors increase their holdings in a stock, the volatility, volume, and the return of the stock all drop, as theory would predict. Exposure to a portfolio of stocks held by disposition-prone investors explains cross-sectional differences in daily returns, controlling for other factors and characteristics.

To develop a universally applicable model for constructing a portfolio that tracks an index as accurately as possible, one should focus primarily on its practical use in the period after optimization. The objective is to define a limited number of stocks for the portfolio and to maintain it with minimal transaction costs. The approach proposed here requires fewer undesirable assumptions than we see in other approaches to indexing.

Equities have generally prospered in the second half of a president's term, especially during the third year. Further analysis reveals that monetary policy actions correspond with the identified return pattern-Fed policy has generally been significantly more accommodative during the third year of a president's term. The evidence overall strongly suggests that investors should carefully monitor the actions of policymakers and the political calendar before they make investment decisions.</description><author>Beyer, Scott B.; Jensen, Gerald R.; Johnson, Robert R.</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2008 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Active equity managers in the US: Do the best follow momentum strategies?</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Mulvey, John M.; Kim, Woo Chang
Empirical evidence from a database free of survivorship bias shows that the excess return patterns of long-only industry-level momentum strategies are highly correlated with active fund returns in the growth and the core domains, especially since publication of the momentum effect phenomenon in 1993. The best-performing managers are more strongly similar than the poorest-performing managers, who have low correlation with momentum. Investment performance of momentum strategies at the industry level is competitive, or between the top 10% and top 25% of funds in each period. The source and the persistence of these patterns compared to optimal asset allocation are cause for speculation.</description><author>Mulvey, John M.; Kim, Woo Chang</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2008 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>The predictive ability of the bond-stock earnings yield differential model</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Berge, Klaus; Consigli, Giorgio; Ziemba, William T.
In this article, the authors survey the bond-stock prediction model for five worldwide equity markets. This model is useful for predicting the time-varying equity risk premium (ERP) and for strategic asset allocation of bond-stock equity mixes. The focus is on the model's economic and financial implications and its application to the study of stock market strategies and corrections. The model has two versions. The first model, formulated more than 35 years ago by Ziemba and Schwartz, is the difference between the most liquid long bond, usually the 10- or 30-year bond, and the trailing equity yield. The idea is that asset allocation between stocks and bonds is related to their relative yields. When the bond yield is too high, a shift out of stocks into bonds can cause an equity market correction. This model predicted the 1987 2000, and 2002 corrections in the United States and the 1;90 correction in Japan. The second model and equivalent version, the Fed model, uses the ratio, or equivalently the logs, of the two yields, and has its origins in reports and statements from the Federal Reserve System under Alan Greenspan dating from about 1996. The ERP can thus be negative or positive and is, therefore, partially predictable. Despite its predictive ability, the bond-stock model has been criticized as being theoretically unsound because it compares a nominal quantity (the long-bond yield) with a real quantity (the earnings yield on stocks). Theoretical models of fairly priced equity indices can be derived and compared to actual index values to ascertain danger levels.</description><author>Berge, Klaus; Consigli, Giorgio; Ziemba, William T.</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2008 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>The concept of credit OAS in valuation of MBS</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Levin, Alexander; Davidson, Andrew
Neither the traditional option-adjusted spread (OAS) method nor a static loss forecasting is capable of providing a rational explanation of the pricing of traded asset-backed securities (ABS), credit default swaps, and loan protections. In this article, the authors introduce the concept of credit OAS, which revolves around the stochasticity of both interest rates and home prices. The credit OAS approach requires a risk-neutral stochastic model of home prices, a model of defaults and losses (theoretical or empirical), and a rigorous and efficient valuation scheme. The authors discuss how the risk-neutral conditions can be formed from concurrently observed prices of ABS tranches up and down the credit structure. An alternative is to analyze the cost of a GSE guarantee inclusive of capital requirements to support the guarantee. The authors illustrate their method with case studies in both liquid and illiquid markets. Even distressed market prices can be explained by a combination of modeled losses and a properly selected credit OAS level (i.e., liquidity spread). The greeks (risk measures), however, depend strongly on the modeling details (such as the link between interest rates and home prices), vary widely from model to model, and tend to be far away from traditional measures.</description><author>Levin, Alexander; Davidson, Andrew</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2008 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Portfolio investing with EVA</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Zaima, Janis K.
Investment strategy using the EVA metric has gained popularity, particularly with Fortune's publication of the top wealth creators as calculated by Stern Stewart &amp; Co. In this article, the author examines if portfolios created with higher EVA firms lead to higher returns. Two anomalies exist. First, negative EVA to market value (EVA-MV) firms earn, on average, the highest portfolio returns over a 10-year period. Second, the relationship between the EVA-MV ratio and portfolio returns is not linear, but U-shaped. However, when a reward-to-risk measure is utilized, a positive linear risk-return relationship prevails, providing evidence that the EVA-MV ratio is a proxy for risk.</description><author>Zaima, Janis K.</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2008 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Why have estimate revision measures not worked in recent years?</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Xu, Peter
Estimate revisions, whether measured using consensus or individual analyst data, continue to exhibit positive serial correlation. This suggests that the failure of estimate revision strategies in recent years was a result of investor overreaction to the widely known bias in analyst estimates. To measure this overreaction, the author presents a model that compares the persistence of estimate revisions expected by investors and the actual level of persistence warranted by analyst behavior. The results suggest that instead of simply selecting stocks with positive estimate revisions, the new task for active managers is to determine how much information in estimate revisions is already reflected in stock prices.</description><author>Xu, Peter</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2008 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Analyzing and estimating real stock returns</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Jones, Charles P.
What is the likelihood that real stock returns will average approximately 7% in the future, as they have done in the past? The author addresses this issue by analyzing the components of real stock returns over the period 1926 to 2005. The analysis allows investors to both understand real stock returns and make informed estimates of average real returns going forward. Although the typical case being made today for lower stock returns in the future is apparent, given today's significantly lower dividend yield, the author explores the conditions under which real returns can continue at their historical average. Using this framework, investors can easily substitute their expectations about real earnings growth and market valuations into the model to make intelligent estimates of average real returns over some future period.</description><author>Jones, Charles P.</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2008 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Greenspan vs. the gold standard</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Bernstein, Peter L.

Distressed debt is a large and growing segment of the fixed-income market. In this article, the authors expand the empirical basis for active management with evidence on risk and reward. They calculate a one-year default rate of 22% for the category, whether defined by spread or by price. That rate is more than 20 times as high as non-distressed speculative-grade debt. They also address the longstanding question of whether non-distressed investors should automatically take losses on bonds that fall below a stated price threshold. The evidence on price change argues against this strategy, based on a threshold of 70, but the cost of continuing to hold is a higher default rate than many investors can tolerate. Finally, a strong correlation indicates that distressed investors earn the highest returns on the lowest-priced bonds, but there is a severe penalty for selecting the wrong issues.</description><author>Fridson, Martin; Covey, Kevin P.; Sterling, Karen</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2008 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Determinants of stock prices: New international evidence</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>De Bondt, Gabe J.
In this article, the author presents a simple stock price model for major country economies. The model assumes a long-run fair stock market value and short-run deviations from fair value. In the long run, only fundamentals matter. In addition to the discussion of earnings and the risk-free interest rate, the author considers a proxy for the long-run equity risk premium. In the short run, other factors might determine stock prices, such as the exchange rate, commodity prices, momentum, and seasonality. Out-of-sample forecasting statistics indicate that the stock price model clearly outperforms a random walk model. Exploiting the forecasting accuracy in practice is difficult, however, because the stock price determinants, especially the short-run risk premium, are difficult to predict. By contrast, the long-run stock price model reliably guides investors about the degree of over- or undervaluation of stock markets from their long-run fair fundamental levels. Two different investment strategies illustrate the ability of the long-run stock price model to generate excess returns.</description><author>De Bondt, Gabe J.</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2008 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Fundamental indexation and international diversification</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Estrada, Javier
Just as fundamental indexation is novel and controversial, international diversification is traditional and widely accepted. In this article, the author links both issues and evaluates a fundamental strategy of international diversification. Considering 16 country benchmarks that make up over 93% of world market capitalization and a 32-year (1974-2005) sample period, the results show that a dividend-weighted fundamental index outperforms a cap-weighted index by the substantial margin of 190 bps a year. If, however, investors are willing to abandon cap-weighted portfolios, the results also show that a simple value strategy which weights the same country benchmarks by dividend yield outperforms the dividend-weighted fundamental index by 170 bps a year over the same period. All the strategies evaluated by the authors can be easily implemented with widely available low-cost country index funds and exchange-traded funds.</description><author>Estrada, Javier</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2008 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Correlation, return gaps, and the benefits of diversification</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Statman, Meir; Scheid, Jonathan
Correlation is the common indicator for the benefits of diversification, but it is not a good indicator for two reasons. First, the benefits of diversification depend not only on the correlation between returns, but also on the standard deviation of returns. Second, correlation does not provide an intuitive measure of the benefits of diversification. Return gaps are better indicators. A return gap is the difference in return between two assets or two portfolios. For example, as the authors show, the estimated 12-month return gap between the S&amp;P 500 Index and the Russell 2000 Index from February 2002 to January 2007 was 8.90%. This return gap implied that investors who concentrated their portfolios in one index or the other should have expected to lead or lag investors who diversified between the two in equal proportions by 4.45%. The realized 12-month return gaps ranged from 0.1% to 28.7%. It is difficult to intuitively deduce these figures from the relatively high 0.82 correlation between the two indices. Likewise, it is difficult to intuitively deduce from the relatively high 0.86 correlation between the S&amp;P 500 and EAFE indices that, over this same period, their estimated 12-month return gap was 6.86% and realized 12-month return gaps ranged from 1.8% to 23.0%. Moreover, the figures belie any claim that these assets' risk-reduction benefits have largely vanished.</description><author>Statman, Meir; Scheid, Jonathan</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2008 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Sharpe's state-preference approach and beyond: A practitioner overview</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Fogler, H. Russell
In his recent book, Nobel Prize-winner William Sharpe notes that, in contrast to MBA curricula focusing on the capital asset pricing model (CAPM), "[i]f you were to attend a Ph.D. finance class... you would learn about no-arbitrage pricing, state claim prices, complete markets, spanning, asset pricing kernels, stochastic discount factors, and risk-neutral probabilities." Sharpe's illustration of these concepts in a state-preference framework raises important questions for practitioners. Has the role of CAPM beta changed? Should investors still expect asset returns to be linear in beta as in the CAPM? What are the implications for other asset pricing models, such as arbitrage pricing theory (APT)? How does the state-preference framework clarify issues such as anomalies found by CAPM researchers, the peso problem, nonstationary volatility, tail risk, correlations going to unity in crises, smiles in option pricing, and the equity premium puzzle? The author provides an overview of Sharpe's work and addresses these practitioner questions.</description><author>Fogler, H.

The fields of psychology and sociology offer a large body of theory and evidence on how individual behavior differs from group behavior, particularly for performance and risk-taking activities. Relatively little attention, however, has been devoted to this topic in regard to managed portfolios, even though over 50% of mutual funds are managed by a team. In this article, the authors provide an empirical examination of whether funds managed by individuals perform differently from funds managed by teams. Using a sample of about 3,000 equity mutual funds over a 12-year horizon, the authors find that although the number of funds managed by teams has grown at seven times the rate of funds managed by individuals, no significant difference in risk-adjusted performance is observed between team-managed and individually managed funds. Funds managed by teams, however, are significantly less risky and exhibit lower turnover. In addition, the total cost of owning a team-managed mutual fund is, on average, nearly 50 bps lower per year than: the cost of owning an individually managed mutual fund. Finally, team-managed funds attract significantly greater investor flows than individually managed funds, even after controlling for performance, risk, and expenses.</description><author>Bliss, Richard T.; Potter, Mark E.; Schwarz, Christopher</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2008 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Dividends versus share repurchase: The stock price effect</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Bierman, Harold
To what extent should the board of directors and top management consider the immediate effect on stock price of the firm's distribution policy? The conclusions of this article are consistent with those of the well-known Black-Scholes option pricing model-a firm's underlying profitability affects its long-term stock price, not its dividend policy decisions. Beyond the short-run effect on investors who are selling the firm's shares, one should not consider the stock price effect of the distribution policy. If the stock price was initially a fair price, the firm cannot sustain the increased price because of the market psychology regarding a dividend increase. If an increased stock price were sustained, then the holders of the stock would earn below-market required returns.</description><author>Bierman, Harold</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2008 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>An assessment of terrorism-related investing strategies</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Karolyi, G.

Do terrorism-related investing strategies generate abnormal returns or risks? Employing two strategies for US. stocks over the past decade, the author finds that this is not the case. The first strategy evaluates a subportfolio of S&amp;P 500 stocks which is constructed based on a terrorism-related risk score that measures a company's degree of operations in countries with a high incidence of terrorism-related activity The second strategy evaluates a "terror-free" portfolio of S&amp;P 500 stocks that are screened based on the presence of a company's operations in countries deemed state sponsors of terrorism by the U.S. Department of State. The author finds that the terrorism-related risk exposure portfolio would have earned, on average, an economically small and statistically insignificant 16 bps premium per month with a tracking error of 2.8% per month and the terror-free portfolio would have earned an even smaller -1.6 bps premium per month with a tracking error of 25 bps per month. Return attribution analysis using a multifactor model uncovers interesting differences in systematic exposures to market risks and factors related to size, market-to-book ratios, and momentum.</description><author>Karolyi, G.

Modern options theory assumes that securities markets are complete and processes are known. But how should options be priced when markets are not complete and price processes are not known? The maximum-entropy framework, which formalizes the efficient market hypothesis, offers process-free option valuation in incomplete markets. This article reviews the gamma model for pricing stock options and the beta model for pricing bond options, both obtained in the maximum-entropy framework. Both models are as convenient as the Black-Scholes model, but unlike the Black-Scholes model they are valid in incomplete markets and do not restrict prices, interest rates, or volatilities to any specific paths. The gamma and beta models are both less restrictive and more accurate than alternative option valuation models.</description><author>Gulko, Les</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2008 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Expected return and risk of covered call strategies</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Figelman, Ilya
This article provides a theoretical framework for analyzing a covered-call stock index strategy relative to the underlying stock index itself. The framework proposed allows for the decomposition and explanation of the strong historical performance of covered call strategies, which has been documented in several other articles. Formulas for the expected return and risk (semi-standard deviation) of the covered call strategy are derived and empirical comparisons to the underlying stock index are provided. The author defines a new concept, the call risk premium, which is the difference between a call's real world expected value and its price. A key insight of this article is that investors considering a covered call strategy must consider the positive effect of the implied-realized volatility spread versus the negative effect of the equity risk premium. A second insight is that, as the time to call option expiration decreases, the volatility spread effect significantly strengthens and the equity risk premium effect slightly weakens. Hence, it is usually better to implement the covered call strategy with short-dated call options. This finding is consistent with the intuition of most practitioners.</description><author>Figelman, Ilya</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2008 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>How unlucky is 25-sigma?</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Dowd, Kevin; Cotter, John; Humphrey, Chris; Woods, Margaret

In this article, the author discusses the basic principles and implementation considerations behind portfolio tail-risk management, emphasizing the importance of viewing tail risk as the consequence of a systemic shock during which normally uncorrelated markets become correlated due to a reduction in liquidity. This approach suggests that tail risk should be measured by performing macro scenario analysis and that hedges should be picked based on their cost and joint performance in periods of stress relative to the portfolio being hedged. Since liquidity reduction is a typical consequence of systemic shocks, the author also discusses specific operational issues that come to the fore in such events.</description><author>Bhansali, Vineer</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2008 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Taming global village risk</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Sullivan, Rodney N.
Asset price bubbles build and burst today much as they have since modern capital markets first evolved some 300 years ago. In recent decades, although the real economy has become less volatile, the financial markets have not; they remain volatile and unpredictable. Exploring the driving forces behind market volatility provides investors a basis for an effective response in dealing with market risk. Markets are, in effect, complex adaptive systems. They are composed of a great number of decentralized decision makers who are continually digesting information and interacting in unanticipated and nonlinear ways. That markets are complex adaptive systems has critical implications for how we think about and manage investment risk. In risk management, we must focus on the market mechanisms driving capital markets to higher volatility, including the emotions of investors, complexity of adaptive markets, and advances in technology and mathematical modeling. Improving risk management means finding new tools to measure the interconnectedness of markets plus the total amount of systemic risk, leverage, and liquidity in the markets. With improvements in risk management, investors and regulators will be better equipped to mitigate the market volatility that often culminates in financial market instability.</description><author>Sullivan, Rodney N.</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2008 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Benchmarking measures of investment performance with perfect-foresight and bankrupt asset allocation strategies</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Grauer, Robert R.

Following recent research on the relevance of idiosyncratic risk in asset pricing models, the author proposes using total volatility as a model-free estimate of a stock's excess expected return and analyzes the implications, in terms of design, for improved equity benchmarks. The author finds that maximum Sharpe ratio portfolios are consistent with such expected return proxies and, if built upon improved estimates of the correlation parameters, will significantly outperform market cap-weighted schemes on a risk-adjusted basis. This analysis, which rehabilitates the role of the tangency portfolio from modern portfolio theory, suggests that better equity benchmarks can be designed, provided that a sophisticated portfolio optimization procedure is used that relies on robust estimates of moments and co-moments of stock return distributions.

The fundamental law of active portfolio management provides profound insights on the value creation process of managed funds and shows how forecasts of alphas or forecasting skins can be transformed into the value-added of an active portfolio. A key weakness of the law and its various extensions is that they ignore the estimation errors associated with the parameter inputs of the law. In this article, the author shows that the estimation errors have a substantial impact on the value-added and can easily destroy all the value promised by the law if not dealt with carefully. To minimize the impact of the estimation errors, the author proposes two methods-scaling and diversification. The scaling method scales the estimated optimal active portfolio by a suitable proportion to maximize the valued-added. The diversification approach suggests holding other portfolios along with the estimated optimal active portfolio in order to diversify away much of the estimation errors. The author shows that the two methods can be effectively used to minimize the impact of the estimation errors so as to substantially improve the valued-added.</description><author>Zhou, Guofu</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2008 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Do risk factors eat alphas?</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Lee, Jyh-Huei; Stefek, Dan
Although widespread, the practice in portfolio optimization of using different factor models for risk and alpha has potential pitfalls. Discrepancies between risk and alpha factors can create unintended exposures in optimized portfolios that may hamper performance. An analysis reveals the root of the problem. The optimizer emphasizes the portion of the manager's alpha that is not captured by the risk factors. Aligning the risk and alpha models may lead to better portfolios, even if doing so worsens the overall risk forecasts. In this article, four ways of remedying these problems are presented and compared using familiar optimization problems. The results are promising.</description><author>Lee, Jyh-Huei; Stefek, Dan</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2008 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>The impact of constraints on value-added</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Scherer, Bernd; Xu, Xiaodong
