"Upside participation and downside protection" is a popular motto for many investors. It has taken on much more significance in recent years, in the wake of the global financial crisis. But how do we define and evaluate strategies from the perspective of "upside participation and downside protection"? In this article, the authors present an analytic framework in which they provide a quantitative definition of upside and downside participation ratio, define participation ratio difference as a goodness measure for defensive strategies, and prove a relationship between the participation ratio difference and traditional alpha. As an illustration, they apply this new analysis to the S&amp;P 500 Index and its 10 sectors and show that defensive, low-beta sectors tend to have positive participation ratio differences, while cyclical, high-beta sectors tend to have negative participation ratio differences. This finding is consistent with the low-beta/volatility anomaly and provides another explanation for the popularity of low-beta/volatility strategies.</description><author>Qian, Edward</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2015 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>The Resale Value of Risk-Parity Equity Portfolios</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Sorensen, Eric H.; Alonso, Nicholas F.
This article examines the application of risk parity to fully diversify an equity portfolio. It presents wealth accumulation in a stochastic dominance framework, tested over increasing investment horizons. The portfolio construction algorithms consider sector, country, and stocks in achieving an alternative to capitalization-weighted approaches. Risk parity is dominant over 75% of the historical periods for any two-year horizon and is dominant in all cases after six-year horizons. It achieves dominance over capitalization-weighted indices over shorter horizons during periods of higher market volatility, periods of higher inflation, and periods with steep yield curves.</description><author>Sorensen, Eric H.; Alonso, Nicholas F.</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2015 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>A Penalty Cost Approach to Strategic Asset Allocation with Illiquid Asset Classes</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Hayes, Mark; Primbs, James A.; Chiquoine, Ben
Traditional approaches to asset allocation do not directly address the issue of liquidity. The financial crisis brought liquidity management to the forefront for several large university endowments investors who heretofore had been considered thought leaders in their approaches to asset allocation. The authors discuss a new approach developed at Stanford University that modifies the familiar mean variance optimization framework by incorporating an illiquidity-related marginal penalty function that varies with each investor's liquidity needs. The new methodology allows for an explicit, easily communicated, and natural specification of illiquidity preferences that works in conjunction with the standard Markowitz approach to solve the asset-allocation problem faced by today's institutional investors.</description><author>Hayes, Mark; Primbs, James A.; Chiquoine, Ben</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2015 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>A Conclusion for Most CEOs: Your Corporation Should Not Pay Dividends</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Bierman, Harold

In his previous articles, however, the author notes that he failed to take into account the possibility that corporations, in the present tax environment, should normally pay zero dividends. In this article, the author concludes that corporations should normally pay zero cash dividends, unless their stockholders do not pay income taxes.</description><author>Bierman, Harold</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2015 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Market Transparency and the Marking Precision of Bond Mutual Fund Managers</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Cici, Gjergji; Gibson, Scott; Gunduz, Yalin; Merrick, John J.
The validity of the price marks placed on bonds for valuation purposes is important for a diverse group of stakeholders, including investors, mutual fund managers, dealers, pricing services, and financial regulators. The authors analyze the dispersion of month-end price marks simultaneously placed on identical corporate bonds by different U.S. mutual fund managers, before and after TRACE dissemination and issuer introductions into Markit's Credit Default Swap spread database. The authors find large and statistically significant decreases in newly disseminated bonds around key TRACE system rollout events. Dispersion for large, investment-grade bonds fell 20% to 83% after the start of TRACE reporting. They also find evidence of spillover effects for non-disseminated bonds. During the pre-TRACE period, some evidence that mark dispersion fell for investment-grade issuers after introductions into Markit's database is reported. The results provide support for the idea that the TRACE transparency initiative reduced information inequality within the market's institutional side. The original NASD concern about people "operating largely in the dark" effectively applied to professional fund managers.</description><author>Cici, Gjergji; Gibson, Scott; Gunduz, Yalin; Merrick, John J.</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2015 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>A Liquidity Program to Stabilize Equity Markets</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Alan, Nazli Sila; Mask, John S.; Schwartz, Robert A.
The authors consider a program that, by bringing additional liquidity to the equity markets, would benefit market participants, listed companies, an exchange, and the broader economy. Established by an issuer, managed by a third-party, broker-dealer intermediary, formally structured and maximally transparent, the program involves corporate share repurchase in a falling market and issuance in a rising market. Simulation analysis is used to assess the procedure for 30 DOW and 30 DAX stocks over the five-year span of 2008 to 2012. Their findings indicate that the program can generate profits for firms that institute it. The authors suggest that additional steps be taken to refine, further test, and implement the procedure.</description><author>Alan, Nazli Sila; Mask, John S.; Schwartz, Robert A.</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2015 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>What's in the News? Using News Sentiment Momentum for Tactical Asset Allocation</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Uhl, Matthias W.; Pedersen, Mads; Malitius, Oliver
News and news sentiment often influence financial markets and asset prices. Investors commonly recognize this, but only a few studies have used news sentiment in news to predict future financial market developments and to formulate alpha-generating strategies, let alone create a best-practice approach for tactical asset allocation. In order to fill this gap, the authors combine company- and macro-specific news sentiment from around 100,000 news pieces per week and use the CUSUM (cumulative sum) filter method to calculate momentum in news sentiment. With this approach, they obtain a strategy that delivers solid outperformance with an information ratio of 0.8, while switching as few as eight times per year (on average), making it practicable for both tactical asset allocators and investors in general.</description><author>Uhl, Matthias W.; Pedersen, Mads; Malitius, Oliver</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2015 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>How Much Error Is in the Tracking Error? The Impact of Estimation Risk on Fund Tracking Error</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Woodgate, Artemiza; Siegel, Andrew F.
The authors explain optimized portfolios' poor out-of-sample performance (to minimize tracking error relative to a given benchmark, while achieving a specified expected excess return) in the presence of estimation error in the underlying asset means and covariances. The theoretical bias adjustments for this estimation risk developed by the authors involves taking mathematical expectations of asymptotically expanded future returns of portfolios formed with estimated weights. They provide closed-form adjustments for estimates of the expectation and standard deviation of the portfolio's excess returns. The adjustments significantly reduce bias in global equity portfolios, reduce the costs of rebalancing portfolios, and are robust to sample size and non-normality. By using these approximation methods before investing, it may be possible to assess the effect of statistical estimation error on tracking-error-optimized portfolio performance.</description><author>Woodgate, Artemiza; Siegel, Andrew F.</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2015 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Smart Beta: The Owner's Manual</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Kahn, Ronald N.; Lemmon, Michael
Smart-beta products have captured the interest of investors. But where do they fit in their portfolios? The typical investor, who currently owns active and index products, should own active, index, and smart-beta products. This article introduces a framework that decomposes any strategy's return over time into a broad capitalization-weighted index return, the return to static exposures to smart-beta factors, the return to timing smart-beta factors, and the return above and beyond smart beta. Smart-beta risk constitutes roughly one-third of the active risk of an average active equity manager, and roughly two-thirds of the active risk of an average fixed-income manager. Diversifying across active managers increases the fraction in smart beta. Most investors will want all of these return sources in their portfolio, and this framework facilitates optimizing the blend.</description><author>Kahn, Ronald N.; Lemmon, Michael</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2015 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Extreme Correlations and Optimizing for Stress</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Phoa, Wesley
Asset correlations often change significantly during periods of financial market dislocation.

This lets investors apply standard mean variance techniques to analyze investment strategy under extreme conditions. Applications include risk management and constructing optimally defensive portfolios for stressed markets. The method is based on recent advances in multivariate extreme-value theory.</description><author>Phoa, Wesley</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2015 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Inflation-Protecting Asset Allocation: A Downside Risk Analysis</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Koniarski, Tim; Sebastian, Steffen
This article studies the inflation-protection qualities of cash, bonds, stocks, and direct real estate, and the optimal inflation-protecting asset allocations within a downside risk framework. Using a value-at-risk model to capture predictable price dynamics, the authors find that the inflation-hedging properties of assets substantially change over the investment horizon. Cash is clearly the best hedge against inflation in the short run. However, as the investment horizon increases, bonds, stocks, and real estate become the more attractive options, with real estate exhibiting the best inflation-protection qualities on a medium- and long-term basis. While cash plays the most important role in short-term portfolios, the weights of the inflation-protecting portfolios shift to real estate, stocks, and bonds as the investment horizon increases.</description><author>Koniarski, Tim; Sebastian, Steffen</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2015 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Risk Parity Optimality</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Fisher, Gregg S.; Maymin, Philip Z.; Maymin, Zakhar G.
In this article, the authors show under general conditions that the probability of risk parity beating any other portfolio is more than 50%. They also prove the maximin properties of a risk-parity portfolio under two scenarios: 1) when all assets' future Sharpe ratios are greater than some positive unknown constant and all correlations are less than another unknown constant, or 2) when the sum of all assets' future Sharpe ratios is greater than some unknown constant. In each case, the authors show that risk parity is the unique maximin portfolio. Finally, the authors empirically confirm their theoretical results for the two main asset classes.</description><author>Fisher, Gregg S.; Maymin, Philip Z.; Maymin, Zakhar G.</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2015 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Economics: An Empirical Science Capable of Forecasting Economic Events?</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Focardi, Sergio M.; Fabozzi, Frank J.

Commercial buildings represent a significant share of global energy consumption. In the general absence of regulation, voluntary labeling and green building certification schemes have been introduced to reflect this externality to building owners and tenants. The implications of such schemes have previously been documented to affect building financial performance. However, existing studies have focused mostly on the U.S. market and, more importantly, generally include only a limited set of performance metrics. Using a rich, proprietary dataset from one of the largest building owners/managers in North America, the authors investigate the effects of green building certification on non-financial metrics, such as tenant satisfaction, incentives, and lease renewal. Their empirical results show that buildings certified through voluntary labeling schemes generally have a higher probability of lease renewal, offer lower incentives, and have more satisfied tenants They then study the effects of green building certification on financial metrics, such as rents and occupancy levels. The findings for the U.S. sample unambiguously confirm previously documented results-LEED and ENERGY STAR certified buildings command a small rent premium and have a lower vacancy risk. For Canada, the effects for LEED certified buildings are consistent with U.S. results. The results show that the national green building scheme is not priced in, but that these buildings still offer greater overall stability versus non-certified buildings through increased releasing rates, lower incentives, and substantially higher tenant satisfaction levels. The findings reported in this article provide an important contribution to the understanding of underlying value drivers in more efficient, sustainable buildings and offer some first evidence for the international validity of otherwise mostly U.S.-based studies on the financial performance of more efficient, "green" commercial buildings.</description><author>Devine, Avis; Kok, Nils</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Sep 2015 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>THE VOLATILITY OF REAL ESTATE MARKETS: A Decomposition</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Wheaton, William C.
The research reported in this article examines how the volatility of real estate markets can be exactly decomposed into supply-side and demand-side factors that add up. What allows this is measuring volatility with vacancy, rather than examining rents, income, or investment return. In this decomposition, the role of supply depends keenly on its timing relative to demand side shocks. When the correlation between the two sides of the market is sufficiently positive, supply can help to reduce market volatility. Negative correlations imply that supply always contributes to market volatility. Empirically, the author compares the overall volatility of 50 metropolitan markets, across several property types (offices, apartments, industrial, and hotels) and finds very different decompositions across the types. With these decompositions, the author tries to characterize those kinds of markets (geographically within each type of property) whose volatility is driven more by demand rather than by supply factors.</description><author>Wheaton, William C.</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Sep 2015 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>WHAT'S IN A LOAN YIELD? The Construction of a Hedonic Index of Yields for Commercial Real Estate Mortgages</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Chervachidze, Serguei; Gallagher, Mark; Wheaton, William C.
In this article, the authors investigate the utility of using a hedonic model in constructing an index of yields on commercial mortgage loans. They use a large unique proprietary dataset of mortgage originations from 2000Q3-2012Q4 to construct a hedonic model of yields as a function of loan characteristics as well as time effects. The authors then use the hedonic model to construct a constant-quality index of mortgage yields and test whether the index performs better in uncovering underlying equilibrium relationships with other economy-wide yield variables than a simple average of yields. They find evidence that is strongly in favor of a hedonic index. Finally, the authors build a forecasting model of the hedonic index as a function of a widely available index of corporate bond yields and test the forecasting performance of the model. The major finding is that the index works well in a forecasting model and lends itself readily to forecasting applications.</description><author>Chervachidze, Serguei; Gallagher, Mark; Wheaton, William C.</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Sep 2015 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>THE POST-CRISIS CMBS MARKET: Will Regulations Prevent Another Market Meltdown?</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Fabozzi, Frank J.; Mcbride, Joe; Clancy, Manus
In this article, the authors discuss the importance and development of the commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) market. They then review several issues that will play an important role in fostering recovery of the CMBS market or impeding the CMBS markets or particular segments within that market: (1) the risk-retention rule applicable to commercial real estate loans and CMBS under the Dodd Frank Act, (2) the U.S. federal banking regulators' adoption of the U.S. Basel III rule, and (3) federal government participation in the reinsurance market for terrorist insurance.</description><author>Fabozzi, Frank J.; Mcbride, Joe; Clancy, Manus</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Sep 2015 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>DO PUBLIC REAL ESTATE RETURNS REALLY LEAD PRIVATE RETURNS?</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Hoesli, Martin; Oikarinen, Elias; Serrano, Camilo
In this article, the authors use sector-level unlevered real estate investment trust (REIT) and direct real estate data to study whether the "escrow lag" in the recording of private market prices could explain the observed lead lag relationship between REITs and direct real estate markets. They find evidence of REIT returns leading private returns in the office and retail sectors even after catering for a 90-day escrow lag. These lead lag relationships are due to the slow reaction of private market returns to shocks in REIT returns, the risk premium, and consumer sentiment. In contrast, the authors do not observe such a lead lag relationship in the apartment and industrial sectors. The findings have implications regarding portfolio allocation, return predictability, and recommended shifts in the allocation between private and public real estate during crisis periods.</description><author>Hoesli, Martin; Oikarinen, Elias; Serrano, Camilo</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Sep 2015 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>AVERAGES TELL You LITTLE: The Effects of Multifamily Construction on Rents</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Nordby, Hans; Taylor, Michael; Everett, Lee
Over the next several years, U.S. commercial real estate will likely see one of the largest supply waves of multifamily product in recent memory. In this article, the authors examine two economically strong markets, Austin and Boston, which have already started to see significant multifamily construction. The authors look at rent growth of existing properties before and after deliveries in 2013, separating properties by distance to the 2013 deliveries. They find that there is a strong effect on the rent growth of existing properties based on how close they are to new construction. In general, the results show that proximity to new construction is beneficial to average-quality 3 Star properties and detrimental to higher-quality 4 Star and 5 Star properties. The findings reported by the authors will help investors to better position their portfolios against the effects of increased multifamily supply.</description><author>Nordby, Hans; Taylor, Michael; Everett, Lee</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Sep 2015 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Conditional Allocations to Real Estate: An Antidote to Sequencing Risk in Defined Contribution Retirement Plans</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Drew, Michael E.; Walk, Adam N.; West, Jason
In this article, the authors investigate the potential for real estate as an asset class to be exploited to protect against sequencing risk (or path dependency) in defined contribution retirement funds. Their results suggest that allocating both listed and unlisted real estate assets to retirement portfolios, even if very minor, can enhance the risk return profile and probability of successfully achieving retirement outcomes. Using a bootstrap simulation approach, the authors test for a range of asset allocations that include real estate. In addition, they examine the sensitivity of real estate performance to changes in monetary policy to optimize portfolio outcomes for fund managers who actively seek exposure to real estate assets. Their findings indicate that the performance of real estate is highly dependent on monetary policy settings that, when used in a dynamic asset allocation process, have the potential to enhance portfolio returns while limiting the impact of downside risk.</description><author>Drew, Michael E.; Walk, Adam N.; West, Jason</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Sep 2015 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Size Signals Success: Evidence from Real Estate Private Equity</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Krautz, Sebastian; Fuerst, Franz
Anecdotal evidence suggests that clout and connections matter more in private equity fundraising than do actual performance. In this article, a unique real estate private equity dataset with buy-side and sell-side information is created by the authors to construct and analyze stacked interaction networks for each vintage year. Calculating and regressing centrality measures for industry embeddedness, the authors find that fund managers can benefit from their established connections to plan sponsors while fundraising. By adding fund size into the equation, they demonstrate that the total capital under management and the size of previous funds have a significant and positive effect on fundraising speed.</description><author>Krautz, Sebastian; Fuerst, Franz</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Sep 2015 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Performance of Non-Core Private Equity Real Estate Funds: A European View</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Kiehela, Sami; Falkenbach, Heidi
This article examines the performance of European private equity real estate (PERE) funds from 1998 to 2009 using both absolute and relative performance metrics. The authors find that PERE fund absolute returns were significantly dragged down by the financial crisis and, on average, delivered only weak absolute returns. In relative terms, they find that private equity real estate funds underperform the public real estate equities market. They also evaluate the extent of systematic valuation biases of interim fund net asset values and find some evidence of systematic undervaluation of almost 20% of the fund investments, which, when taken into account in performance evaluation, substantially improves the returns.</description><author>Kiehela, Sami; Falkenbach, Heidi</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Sep 2015 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Value and Momentum in Commercial Real Estate: A Market-Level Analysis</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Beracha, Eli; Downs, David H.
Value and momentum strategies are widely recognized by capital market portfolio managers, although commercial real estate evidence is limited. In this article, Beracha and Downs apply these strategies in a market-level analysis using NCREIF data from 1986 through 2014. Conducting the analysis at the market, or MSA level, illustrates its usefulness to an institutional portfolio manager deciding which markets to target or, potentially, exit. Surprisingly, yet consistent with other asset classes, future returns on commercial real estate are positively correlated with the value effect, as measured by relative cap rate, and positively correlated with relative return momentum. Each strategy is robust to risk adjustment and persists over extended investment horizons. As suggested, value and momentum risk factors may benefit institutional investors in establishing benchmarks and monitoring performance.</description><author>Beracha, Eli; Downs, David H.</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Sep 2015 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Does Foreign Investment Affect US Office Real Estate Prices?</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>McAllister, Pat; Nanda, Anupam
This article examines the impact of foreign real estate investment on U.S. office market capitalization rates. The geographic unit of analysis is MSA and the time period is 2001-2013. Drawing upon a database of commercial real estate transactions, the authors model the determinants of market capitalization rates with a particular focus on the significance of the proportion of market transactions involving foreign investors. Employing several econometric techniques to analyze the data, the results suggest statistically significant effects of foreign investment across 38 U.S. metro areas. It is estimated that, all else equal, a 100 basis point increase in foreign share of total investment in a U.S. metropolitan office market causes about an 8 basis point decrease in the market cap rate.</description><author>McAllister, Pat; Nanda, Anupam</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Sep 2015 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Principal-Agent Issues in Real Estate Funds and Joint Ventures</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Pagliari, Joseph L.
The motivations created by the use of incentive fees (or promoted interests) in private equity (real estate or otherwise) are examined through the lens of traditional principal/agent problems. In general, in-the-money promotes tend to create conservative actions by the manager (or agent), and out-of-the-money promotes tend to create risky actions. These incentives are mitigated, however, by a number of factors, including the "moneyness" (the degree to which the promoted interest is in the money) of the promote, the dispersion of potential choices, concerns about future fund-raising efforts, and the changing shape of the manager's utility curve over time (as the manager experiences other gains and losses). Because these incentive fees are intended to improve the alignment of interests between the principal and the agent, this article suggests that lowering both the investor's preferred return and the manager's promoted interest in a manner that maintains the expected value of the promoted interest improves that alignment of interests. Finally, this article also suggests that the use of indexed preferences, rather than a fixed percentage, ought to better serve investors.</description><author>Pagliari, Joseph L.</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Sep 2015 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>New Horizons and Familiar Landscapes: New Capital Sources Confront Shifting Real Estate Fundamentals</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Clayton, Jim; Fabozzi, Frank J.; Giliberto, S. Michael; Gordon, Jacques N.; Liang, Youguo; MacKinnon, Greg; Mansour, Asieh
Real estate has continued to evolve as an asset class. In this introduction to the special issue, the authors examine new sources of capital that have entered real estate, some of which have already had a large impact and others that have the potential to bring major changes in the future. While the capital market foundations of the asset class are changing, the traditional cycle in property fundamentals remains a distinguishing feature, albeit changed from past cycles. As new sources of capital encounter real estate's fundamentals cycle, in-depth understanding of the asset class is imperative. The authors review these trends and suggest how the other articles in this special issue can help investors navigate this confluence of new and old.</description><author>Clayton, Jim; Fabozzi, Frank J.; Giliberto, S.

This article aims to address the relationship between a measure of stock correlation and a decrease in the risk-adjusted performance of basic quantitative investment strategies. The author studied simple momentum, value, size, and mean reversion investment strategies in the U.S. stock market for the period from 1928 to 2012. The empirical results suggest that all strategies appear to be caught in a correlation trap, as they have the tendency to experience a decrease in risk-adjusted performance when the proposed measure of correlation increases. This effect is present over the whole study period, not restricted to the last few years.</description><author>Lamponi, Daniele</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2014 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>No Speed Limits: High-Frequency Trading and Flash Boys</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Bogle, John C.

To exploit return predictability via dynamic asset allocation, investors face the important practical issue of how often to rebalance their portfolios. More frequent rebalancing uses statistically and economically significant short-horizon return predictability to aggressively pursue the dynamic investment opportunities afforded by changes in expected returns. However, the degree of return predictability typically appears stronger at longer horizons, which, along with lower transaction costs, favors less frequent rebalancing. The authors analyze the performance effects of rebalancing frequency in the context of dynamic portfolios constructed from monthly, quarterly, semi-annual, and annual return forecasts for U.S. stocks, bonds, and bills, where the dynamic portfolios rebalance at the same frequency as the forecast horizon. Along the transaction-cost/rebalancing frontier, monthly (annual) rebalancing provides the greatest outperformance when unit transaction costs are below (above) approximately 50 basis points, and dynamic portfolios based on annual rebalancing typically outperform the benchmarks for unit transaction costs well in excess of 400 basis points.</description><author>Almadi, Himanshu; Rapach, David E.; Suri, Anil</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2014 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Enhanced Mean-Variance Portfolios: A Controlled Integration of Quantitative Predictors</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Kaiser, Lars; Menichetti, Marco J.; Veress, Aron
The intuitiveness and practicality of mean variance portfolios largely depend on the accuracy of moment estimates, which are subject to large estimation errors and are conditional on time. The authors propose a model that accounts for factor dynamics in a Bayesian setting, in which they endogenously derive the effect of estimation accuracy on the posterior distribution from a linear predictive regression model. By doing so, they capture upside return potential for periods of high factor-explained variance, while constraining downside risk for periods of low predictive quality. Results are robust in a simulation and an empirical setting.</description><author>Kaiser, Lars; Menichetti, Marco J.; Veress, Aron</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2014 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>On the Expected Performance of Market Timing Strategies</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Hallerbach, Winfried G.
The author derives expressions for the information ratio (IR) that can be expected from directional market-timing strategies. The results hold as accurate approximations and lift the Fundamental Law of Active Management proposed by Richard Grinold in 1989 to an operational level. In addition, the author separates time series-breadth (the timing frequency per strategy) from cross-section breadth (the number of separate markets), because they contribute differently to performance. The author shows that implementing volatility-weighted bet sizes, both in the time series context of a single underlying market and in the cross-section context of multiple markets, increases the expected timing IR. His theoretical results can be used as a benchmark for and reality check on the back-tested performance of timing strategies. He confirms the accuracy of his results by simulating timing strategies for equities and fixed income.</description><author>Hallerbach, Winfried G.</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2014 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>The Glidepath Illusion: An International Perspective</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Estrada, Javier
Target-date funds have become a core product for investors who are saying for retirement. These funds periodically reduce their allocations to stocks and increase their allocations to bonds and cash, becoming more conservative as retirement approaches. This lifecycle strategy implies that investors are aggressive with little capital and conservative with much more capital, which may be suboptimal in terms of wealth accumulation. This article evaluates three alternative types of strategies, including contrarian strategies that follow a glidepath opposite that of target-date funds; that is, they become more aggressive as retirement approaches. The results from a comprehensive sample that spans more than 19 countries, two regions, and 110 years suggest that, relative to lifecycle strategies, the alternative strategies considered here provide investors with higher upside potential, more limited downside potential, and higher uncertainty although that uncertainty is largely limited to how much higher their terminal wealth is expected to grow with these strategies.</description><author>Estrada, Javier</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2014 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>The Limitations of Diversification Return</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Chambers, Donald R.; Zdanowicz, John S.
Diversification return is the amount by which the geometric mean return (i.e., average compounded return) of a portfolio exceeds the weighted average of the geometric means of the portfolio's constituent assets. Diversification return has been touted as a source of added return, even if markets are informationally efficient. Portfolio rebalancing has been advocated as a valuable source of diversification return. The authors demonstrate that diversification return is not a source of increased expected value. However, portfolio rebalancing can be an effective mean-reverting strategy. Any enhanced expected value from rebalancing emanates from mean-reversion, rather than from diversification or variance reduction.</description><author>Chambers, Donald R.; Zdanowicz, John S.</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2014 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Conviction in Equity Investing</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Sebastian, Mike; Attaluri, Sudhakar
In this article, the authors examine the record of active public equity managers by separating investment products into skilled, unskilled, and no evidence of skill categories. They find that less than 2% of products exhibited evidence of skill over the time period. The authors argue that institutional investors spend far more resources on selecting and monitoring active managers than is warranted by the results, either in terms of portfolio results (contribution to risk) or added value. The authors divide their sample into deciles of active risk (volatility of excess returns relative to the investment manager's chosen benchmark, and also Fama-French style benchmarks) and find a clear positive relationship between active risk and value added. They argue that a lack of willingness to take large bets, due to career risk fears, accounts for the poor value-added results of active equity managers and that the preference of institutional investors and their advisors for over-diversification and precise control of risk and style has contributed to the industry's weak record. Investment managers, asset owners, and their advisors, the authors argue, must step up to act with the courage of their convictions in portfolio management.</description><author>Sebastian, Mike; Attaluri, Sudhakar</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2014 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>A Study of Low-Volatility Portfolio Construction Methods</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Chow, Tzee-man; Hsu, Jason C.; Kuo, Li-lan; Li, Feifei
In this study, the authors examine the hypothetical performance of various low volatility strategies in historical U.S., global developed, and emerging markets. The strategies we replicated outperformed cap-weighted market indices due to exposure to the value, BAB (betting against beta), and duration factors. (The duration factor introduced by the authors here is new to the literature.) A reduction in market beta drives the drop in volatility. The authors report that low volatility strategies can contribute to a more risk-diversified equity portfolio which earns long-term returns from multiple premium sources. The lower risk and higher return seem persistent across geographies and over time. Nonetheless, the authors identify flaws with naive approaches to portfolio construction, which tend to result in high turnover, low liquidity, and concentrated country and industry allocations. Additionally, price increases would eliminate low volatility stocks' performance advantage. The conclusion of the authors is that the portfolio construction methods should be sensitive to the investability and valuation levels.</description><author>Chow, Tzee-man; Hsu, Jason C.; Kuo, Li-lan; Li, Feifei</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2014 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Towards Smart Equity Factor Indices: Harvesting Risk Premia without Taking Unrewarded Risks</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Amenc, Noel; Goltz, Felix; Lodh, Ashish; Martellini, Lionel
This article argues that current smart-beta investment approaches provide only a partial answer to the main shortcomings of capitalization-weighted indices and develops a new approach to equity investing, which the authors refer to as smart-factor investing. The authors then provide an assessment of the benefits of simultaneously addressing the two main problems of cap-weighted indices their undesirable factor exposures and their heavy concentration by constructing factor indices that explicitly seek exposures to rewarded risk factors, while diversifying away unrewarded risks. The results suggest that such smart-factor indices lead to considerable improvements in risk-adjusted performance. For long-term U.S. data, smart-factor indices for a range of different factor tilts consistently outperform cap-weighted, factor-tilted indices. Compared with the broad cap-weighted index, smart-factor indices roughly double the risk-adjusted return (Sharpe ratio). Outperformance of such indices persists at levels ranging from 2.92% to 4.46% annually, even when assuming unrealistically high transaction costs. Moreover, by providing explicit tilts to consensual factors, such indices improve upon many current smart-beta offerings where, more often than not, factor tilts exist as unintended consequences of ad hoc methodologies.</description><author>Amenc, Noel; Goltz, Felix; Lodh, Ashish; Martellini, Lionel</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2014 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Is Smart Beta Still Smart after Taxes?</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Vadlamudi, Hemambara; Bouchey, Paul
In this article, the authors focus on the after-tax performance of several smart-beta strategies. These strategies have higher turnover than the capitalization-weighted index, which leads to a greater tax on returns. Despite this drag, most strategies retain a long-term excess return. The authors also test the effectiveness of tax-managed versions of the strategies. They observe that, relative to most active managers, smart-beta strategies have lower turnover, greater breadth, and are less concerned with stock selection. By allowing a tracking-error risk budget versus the original strategy, tax management can reduce much of the tax impact.</description><author>Vadlamudi, Hemambara; Bouchey, Paul</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2014 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Multi-Asset Sentiment and Institutional Investor Behavior: A Cross-Asset Perspective</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Froot, Kenneth A.; Bhargava, Rajeev; Cuipa, Edward S.; Arabadjis, John S.
Greater financial integration and central bank policy initiatives in major developed markets have led to an increase in cross-asset return correlations, highlighting the interest in broad measures of market-wide sentiment. Using an extensive array of institutional behavioral metrics across asset classes, the authors find evidence that suggests market-wide sentiment varies with, and can be forecasted by, broad aggregates across many indicators of institutional investor flows. The large number and wide breadth of these institutional flow measures across assets encourages aggregation into a more manageable set of elements. To this end, the authors condense this broad information set into what they call a multi-asset sentiment score (MASS), a concise measure of behavior that captures trading sentiment using a broad information set.</description><author>Froot, Kenneth A.; Bhargava, Rajeev; Cuipa, Edward S.; Arabadjis, John S.</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2014 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Academic Knowledge Dissemination in the Mutual Fund Industry: Can Mutual Funds Successfully Adopt Factor Investing Strategies?</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>van Gelderen, Eduard; Huij, Joop
The authors investigate whether investors who have adopted investment strategies based on asset pricing anomalies documented in the academic literature consistently earn abnormal returns. They evaluate the performance of a large sample of U.S. equity mutual funds over the period from 1990 to 2010. They find evidence supporting added value for investors who adopt factor-investing strategies: low-beta, small-cap and value funds earn significant excess returns. They also find that these excess returns are sustainable and have not disappeared after the public dissemination of the anomalies. The authors propose some criteria that might be helpful to determine the successful application of academic insights in the context of investment strategies. Their findings have significant implications for the role of academic research and knowledge management in the investment management industry.</description><author>van Gelderen, Eduard; Huij, Joop</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2014 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Evaluating Trading Strategies</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Harvey, Campbell R.; Liu, Yan

Moreover, the S&amp;P 500's index-return variance, average between-constituent return correlation, average constituent relative-return variance, and average constituent residual-return variance are all positively related to a statistically significant degree.

In the current low real-yield environment, institutional investors are challenged as they try to achieve their often-fixed targeted returns within the confines of their investment policy guidelines. If much-discussed solutions, such as risk parity and risk premia investing, are the new answers, they must improve portfolio efficiency and flexibility in taking risks. This article explores the ways these proposed solutions may be successful. The author argues that the solutions neither introduce new assets that offer non-replicable, non-redundant return and risk characteristics, nor do they offer new asset-pricing theories that improve forecasts of asset returns or risks. Instead, their value proposition is more in the category of improved portfolio construction. They primarily benefit practitioners by providing more-efficient risk allocations, which they do by relaxing constraints to which pension investors are often subject, including restrictions on using leverage and short selling.</description><author>Lee, Wai</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2014 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Risk- versus Trend-Driven Global Tactical Asset Allocation</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Guilleminot, Benoit; Ohana, Jean-Jacques; Ohana, Steve
The 2008 financial crisis has severely challenged passive forms of investment. In this article, the authors compare two systematic investment processes that a global asset allocator may employ to preserve its capital in a turbulent financial environment. The risk-driven allocation, derived from the popular risk-parity approach, has garnered a strong interest from both scholars and practitioners in recent years. It aims at enforcing a constant risk target and maintaining a balanced risk profile over time. This article introduces a novel trend-driven approach that enhances the risk-driven strategy by cutting exposure to downward-drifting assets. The authors compare the risk-adjusted performances of risk- and trend-driven approaches on different investment universes (composed of equity, commodity, currency, and bond futures contracts) from 1993 to 2012. They find that a trend-driven approach yields increased Sharpe ratios and lower drawdowns on average, relative to a risk-driven strategy. However, the trend-driven process's outperformance is not stable over time: periods with exploitable trends alternate with long-lasting trendless periods. Overall, the trending strategy's key advantage over the risk-driven one is its greater smoothness. This is due to a better resilience to financial melt-downs like those seen from 2000 to 2002 and in 2008, which are well predicted by trending signals and undermine the diversification objective the risk-parity approach pursues. These results demonstrate the value of coupling risk and trajectorial signals in tactical asset allocation.</description><author>Guilleminot, Benoit; Ohana, Jean-Jacques; Ohana, Steve</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2014 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Rethinking Portfolio Rebalancing: Introducing Risk Contribution Rebalancing as an Alternative Approach to Traditional Value-Based Rebalancing Strategies</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Kohler, Alexander; Wittig, Hagen
The authors propose a new approach to portfolio rebalancing: by decomposing the investor's strategic asset allocation into the various asset classes' percentage contributions to risk. Instead of the asset classes' commonly used value weights, a practitioner would apply this set of risk contributions to controlling rebalancing procedures during the investment phase. In strong contrast to traditional value-based rebalancing strategies, the resulting risk contribution strategies are capable of triggering rebalancing procedures, based on deviations in an asset class's standalone volatility or correlation to the portfolio's remaining asset classes. Thus, this method lets practitioners closely maintain the asset classes' initial risk contributions. In performance terms, during the backtesting sample period from January 1996 to February 2013, the rebalancing strategies based on risk contributions deliver returns that are comparable to traditional value-based rebalancing strategies, but at much lower volatility levels, which translates into higher Sharpe ratios.</description><author>Kohler, Alexander; Wittig, Hagen</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2014 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>The Power of Dynamic Asset Allocation</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Cardinale, Mirko; Navone, Marco; Pioch, Andrzej
This article re-assesses the evidence and practical relevance of asset returns' long-horizon predictability, investigating whether practitioners can profitably exploit predictability patterns by using relatively simple, dynamic asset allocation strategies. The analysis shows forward-looking models that rely on steady-state equations for equities and initial yields to maturity for bonds are far better predictors of markets' long-run direction than is the industry's conventional approach, which involves extrapolating from historical averages. Using a long-term U.S. sample from 1926 to 2010, the authors find that predictability translates into significantly better 34 risk-adjusted performance from dynamic asset allocation strategies that rely on forward-looking inputs.</description><author>Cardinale, Mirko; Navone, Marco; Pioch, Andrzej</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2014 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Exploring Macroeconomic Sensitivities: How Investments Respond to Different Economic Environments</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Ilmanen, Antti; Maloney, Thomas; Ross, Adrienne
A growing number of investors view their portfolios as a collection of exposures to risk factors. Risk-based investing can mean different things to different investors, but the common feature is the emphasis on improved risk diversification. Many investors identify risks primarily as asset class exposures; others may look at underlying macroeconomic exposures, such as inflation sensitivity. The difficulty with the latter approach is that macroeconomic factors are not directly investable. In this article, the authors study the sensitivity of traditional asset classes and dynamic strategies to different macroeconomic environments: growth, inflation, real yields, volatility, and illiquidity. They identify environments that are particularly challenging for investors and find evidence that dynamic systematic strategies, known as style premia, have meaningfully less macro exposure than do asset classes. They also show how diversification reduces portfolios' macro risk exposures.</description><author>Ilmanen, Antti; Maloney, Thomas; Ross, Adrienne</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2014 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Are Flows Costly to ETF Investors?</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Henderson, Brian J.; Buetow, Gerald W.
Authorized participants create and redeem exchange-traded fund (ETF) shares in response to supply and demand imbalances in the secondary market. For the majority of ETFs, share creations and redemptions take place as in-kind transactions, but a growing number of ETFs feature cash creations and redemptions. The authors investigate whether ETF flows are costly to investors. Using a reasonable proxy for the potential cost of fund flows, they find evidence of underperformance associated with flows to ETFs featuring cash creations and redemptions and tracking international benchmarks. Because ETF flows do not predict subsequent returns and the authors do not find evidence the funds are susceptible to market-timing strategies, the costs likely stem from the transaction costs associated with the portfolio trades that are necessary to accommodate cash liquidity.</description><author>Henderson, Brian J.; Buetow, Gerald W.</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2014 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item></channel></rss>
