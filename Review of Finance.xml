Evidence from Hurricane Katrina</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Schuewer, Ulrich; Lambert, Claudia; Noth, Felix
This paper explores how banks react to an exogenous shock caused by Hurricane Katrina in 2005, and how the structure of the banking system affects economic development following the shock. Independent banks based in the disaster areas increase their risk-based capital ratios after the hurricane, while those that are part of a bank holding company on average do not. The effect on independent banks mainly comes from the subgroup of highly capitalized banks. These independent and highly capitalized banks increase their holdings in government securities and reduce their total loan exposures to non-financial firms, while also increasing new lending to these firms. With regard to local economic development, affected counties with a relatively large share of independent banks and relatively high average bank capital ratios show higher economic growth than other affected counties following the catastrophic event.</description><author>Schuewer, Ulrich; Lambert, Claudia; Noth, Felix</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Feb 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Which Factors?</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Hou, Kewei; Mo, Haitao; Xue, Chen; Zhang, Lu
Many recently proposed, seemingly different factor models are closely related. In spanning tests, the q-factor model largely subsumes the Fama-French five- and six-factor models, and the q(5) model subsumes the Stambaugh-Yuan four-factor model. Their "mispricing" factors are sensitive to the construction procedure, and once replicated via the traditional approach, are close to the q-factors, with correlations of 0.8 and 0.84. Finally, consistent with the investment CAPM, valuation theory predicts a positive relation between the expected investment and the expected return.</description><author>Hou, Kewei; Mo, Haitao; Xue, Chen; Zhang, Lu</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Feb 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>The Personal Wealth Interests of Politicians and Government Intervention in the Economy</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Tahoun, Ahmed; van Lent, Laurence
We examine whether there is a correlation between personal wealth interests of politicians and their decisions to intervene in the economy. We use the setting of the government's support of financial institutions under the 2008 Emergency Economic Stabilization Act. We find that the personal wealth interests of politicians are positively associated with voting in favor of the EESA.</description><author>Tahoun, Ahmed; van Lent, Laurence</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Feb 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>The Effects of Horizontal Merger Operating Efficiencies on Rivals, Customers, and Suppliers</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Bernile, Gennaro; Lyandres, Evgeny
We study how operating efficiencies in horizontal mergers affect market reactions of merging firms' rivals, customers, and suppliers. We measure operating efficiency gains using projections disclosed by merging firms' insiders. Higher efficiency gains are associated with lower announcement returns to merging firms' rivals (due to increased equilibrium output of merging firms), higher returns to their customers (due to lower equilibrium price of merging firms' output), and higher returns to their suppliers (due to the merged firm's higher equilibrium demand for inputs). Our results suggest that the pass-through of efficiency gains along merging firms' supply chains is as important as the effects of post-merger changes in market power.</description><author>Bernile, Gennaro; Lyandres, Evgeny</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Feb 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Exploring Mispricing in the Term Structure of CDS Spreads</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Jarrow, Robert; Li, Haitao; Ye, Xiaoxia; Hu, May
Based on a reduced-form model of credit risk, we explore mispricing in the credit default swaps (CDS) spreads of North American companies and its economic content. Specifically, we develop a trading strategy using the model to trade out of sample market-neutral portfolios across the term structure of CDS contracts. Our empirical results show that the trading strategy exhibits abnormally large returns, confirming the existence and persistence of a mispricing. The aggregate returns of the trading strategy are positively related to the square of market-wide credit and liquidity risks, indicating that the mispricing is more pronounced when the market is more volatile. When implemented on the Markit data, the strategy shows significant economic value even after controlling for realistic transaction costs.</description><author>Jarrow, Robert; Li, Haitao; Ye, Xiaoxia; Hu, May</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Feb 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Can Socially Responsible Firms Survive Competition? An Analysis of Corporate Employee Matching Grant Schemes</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Gong, Ning; Grundy, Bruce D.
Employee matching grant schemes are coordination mechanisms that reduce free-riding by socially conscious employee-donors. Matching schemes coupled with lower take-home pay than offered by non-matching firms will survive capital and labor market competition if employee type is not observable and socially conscious employees are more productive or value working together. Matching can enhance employee welfare and raise more for charity without reducing profits. We document that matching firms have higher labor productivity and are more likely to be ranked as one of the "100 Best" employers. The result is robust to managerial entrenchment concerns and is not confined to the high-tech sector.</description><author>Gong, Ning; Grundy, Bruce D.</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Feb 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Does Information Acquisition Alleviate Market Anomalies? Categorization Bias in Stock Splits</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Kong, Dongmin; Lin, Chen; Liu, Shasha
Using a unique proprietary account-level trading dataset in China, we investigate how active information acquisition alleviates price-based return comovement, a typical anomaly in stock splits. We find that: 1) individual trading drives the comovement and the trading correlation between split stocks and the low-price portfolio increases significantly after splits; 2) individuals can learn the firm fundamentals through information acquisition, which effectively alleviates their categorized bias; and 3) the role of information acquisition is more significant in environments characterized by greater uncertainty. Our results are robust to different specifications and alternative measures. Taken together, this paper emphasizes the important role of information acquisition in alleviating behavioral bias and improving decision-making.</description><author>Kong, Dongmin; Lin, Chen; Liu, Shasha</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Feb 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Labor and Capital Dynamics under Financing Frictions</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Michaels, Ryan; Page, T. Beau; Whited, Toni M.
We assemble a new, quarterly panel dataset that links firms' investment and financing to their employment and wages. In the data, wages and leverage are negatively related, both cross-sectionally and within firms. This pattern contradicts models in which firms insure workers against unemployment risk. We reconcile this fact with a model that integrates factor adjustment frictions and wage bargaining with costly external financing. In the model, the probability of default rises with debt. Because default incurs deadweight costs, the expected surplus over which firms and workers bargain falls, thus depressing wages. We show that raising financing costs reduces employment and wages, in line with recent reduced-form evidence.</description><author>Michaels, Ryan; Page, T.

Interpreting Others' Forecasts When Their Information Is Unknown</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Kwasnica, Anthony M.; Velthuis, Raisa; Williams, Jared
We conduct a series of forecasting experiments to examine how people update their beliefs upon observing others' forecasts. Subjects exhibit cursedness, that is, a propensity to underestimate the link between others' forecasts and others' information, which causes subjects to underreact. The behavior of sophisticated subjects is not affected by the framing of information, but unsophisticated subjects switch from underreaction to overreaction when they are only provided qualitative (rather than quantitative) forecast information. Our results have important implications for the way that financial analysts aggregate information and the way that financial institutions present forecasts to their clients.</description><author>Kwasnica, Anthony M.; Velthuis, Raisa; Williams, Jared</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Mar 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Economic Links and Cross-Predictability of Stock Returns: Evidence from Characteristic-Based "Styles"</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Mueller, Sebastian
Prior research has shown that information diffuses gradually across stocks that are economically linked at the industry level. I document a similar pattern when stock portfolios are formed based on characteristics that are used in the anomaly literature (e.g., size, value, asset growth). Specifically, characteristics are useful to identify economic links, and earnings surprises contain information about future returns of other firms that share similar characteristics (i.e., similar-style firms). Such style-based earnings surprises can be used to predict style returns in the time series. For the cross-section of stocks, I create a composite style-based earnings surprise measure (SESM), which generates an equal-weighted (value-weighted) long-short strategy return of 167 (101) basis points per month. I do not find that industry spillovers, the traditional post-earnings announcement drift, unconditional abnormal style returns or risk can explain the return predictability. My findings suggest a further channel of gradual information diffusion in security markets.</description><author>Mueller, Sebastian</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Mar 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>To See Is to Know: Simultaneous Display of Market Data for Retail Investors</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Benamar, Hedi
I test whether the display format of market data affects the trading performance and behavior of retail investors. To do so, I exploit a large brokerage dataset covering a period during which the market information provided to the broker's customers changed in format, but not in content. I find that a simultaneous display of cross-stock market data reduces the cognitive cost of monitoring the market and thus helps investors obtain better execution prices. In particular, investors better mitigate non-execution and adverse-selection risks when trading with limit orders. Hence, the display format of market data matters for the individual investor.</description><author>Benamar, Hedi</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Mar 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Political Uncertainty and Cross-Border Acquisitions</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Cao, Chunfang; Li, Xiaoyang; Liu, Guilin
Using national elections as sources of exogenous variation in uncertainty, we show that political uncertainty affects the volume and outcome of cross-border acquisitions. When a country is about to hold a national election, this deters foreign firms' inbound acquisitions, especially when the host country poses greater expropriation risk. An upcoming home country election encourages firms to conduct outbound cross-border acquisitions, especially to target countries with free-trade agreements, military allies, or countries with better governance. At transaction level, we show that announcement returns to cross-border deals incorporate political uncertainty considerations. Overall, these results shed light on the effects of political uncertainty through the cross-border acquisition channel.</description><author>Cao, Chunfang; Li, Xiaoyang; Liu, Guilin</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Mar 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Do Credit Default Swaps Mitigate the Impact of Credit Rating Downgrades?</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Chava, Sudheer; Ganduri, Rohan; Ornthanalai, Chayawat
We find that a firm's stock price reaction to its credit rating downgrade announcement is muted by 44-52% when credit default swaps (CDSs) trade on its debt. We explore the role of the CDS markets in providing information ex ante and relieving financing frictions ex post for downgraded firms. We find that the impact of CDS trading is more pronounced for firms whose debt financing is more dependent on credit ratings (e.g., those rated around the speculative-grade boundary, those with a higher number of rating-based covenants). Reductions in debt and investment, and the increase in financing costs are less severe for CDS firms than non-CDS firms following an identical credit rating downgrade. Our results suggest that CDSs mute the stock market reaction to a credit rating downgrade by alleviating the financing frictions faced by downgraded firms.</description><author>Chava, Sudheer; Ganduri, Rohan; Ornthanalai, Chayawat</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 May 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Capital Structure and the Substitutability versus Complementarity Nature of Leases and Debt</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Ambrose, Brent W.; Emmerling, Thomas; Huang, Henry H.; Yildirim, Yildiray
The capital structure irrelevance argument of Modigliani and Miller (1958) implies that the use of debt or leases should have no impact on firm values. This classical argument leaves out several important considerations crucial for the result, in particular, counterparty credit risk. We re-examine the capital structure problem for firms that can utilize debt and leases in the presence of counterparty risk. Our numerical and empirical estimates show a negative term structure of lease rates that steepens as a function of counterparty risk. Moreover, we document numerical evidence for the complementary relationship between debt and leases in the presence of counterparty risk.</description><author>Ambrose, Brent W.; Emmerling, Thomas; Huang, Henry H.; Yildirim, Yildiray</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 May 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>The Transmission of Bank Liquidity Shocks: Evidence from House Prices</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Dursun-de Neef, H. Ozlem
This article uses the 2007-09 financial crisis as a negative liquidity shock on banks in the USA and analyzes its transmission to the real economy. The ex ante heterogeneity in the amount of long-term debt that matured during the crisis is used to measure the variation in banks' exposure to the liquidity shock. I find that banks transmitted the liquidity shock to the real economy by reducing their loan supply. The reduction was particularly strong for real estate loans. As a result, house prices declined in the MSAs where these banks have branches. Bank capital plays a significant role in the transmission: under-capitalized banks transmitted the liquidity shock, whereas well-capitalized banks' lending did not show any decline.</description><author>Dursun-de Neef, H.

I find that aggregate asset growth constructed from bottom-up data negatively predicts future market returns both in and out-of-sample and this result is robust across G7 countries. I further show that aggregate asset growth contains information about future market returns not captured by traditional macroeconomic variables and other measures of investment or growth. The forecasting ability of asset growth is strongly correlated with its propensity to predict more optimistic analyst forecasts and subsequent downward revisions, earnings surprise, and systematic errors in investors' expectations. The time-varying risk premium also appears key in explaining the documented return predictability.</description><author>Wen, Quan</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 May 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Mind the Gap: Disentangling Credit and Liquidity in Risk Spreads</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Schwarz, Krista
Euro-area sovereign bond and interbank interest rate spreads spiked in the 2007-2009 Global Financial Crisis and the subsequent European Debt Crisis, substantially elevating financing costs. I use a model-free measure of market liquidity to precisely identify the relative contribution of credit versus liquidity to spreads in these episodes. In the Financial Crisis, liquidity is paramount, accounting for 36% of trough-to-peak widening, after controlling for credit. However, default risk becomes relatively more important to sovereign spreads in the Debt Crisis. Aggregate bond liquidity explains a substantial portion of interbank spreads throughout the sample.</description><author>Schwarz, Krista</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 May 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Renegotiation Frictions and Financial Distress Resolution: Evidence from CDS Spreads</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Campello, Murillo; Ladika, Tomislav; Matta, Rafael
We study how renegotiation frictions impact distressed debt resolution and ex-ante financial contracting. We do so by exploiting an event that exogenously reduced the costs that syndicated lenders incur when renegotiating debt out of court, without affecting in-court restructuring costs (IRS Regulation TD9599). CDS contracts insure creditors against in-court bankruptcy losses and CDS spreads reflect the shadow price of bankruptcy risk. Using a triple-differences approach, we show that CDS spreads fell by record figures on the event's announcement, with declines concentrated among distressed firms that relied most on syndicated loans. Distressed firms' loan renegotiation rates more than doubled, as banks agreed to extend loan maturities in exchange for higher interest payments. Those firms' access to new syndicated loans increased while associated interest markups declined.</description><author>Campello, Murillo; Ladika, Tomislav; Matta, Rafael</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 May 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Linear Approximations and Tests of Conditional Pricing Models</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Brandt, Michael W.; Chapman, David A.
If a nonlinear risk premium in a conditional asset pricing model is approximated with a linear function, as is commonly done in empirical research, the fitted model is misspecified. We use a generic reduced-form model economy with moderate risk premium nonlinearity to examine the size of the resulting misspecification-induced pricing errors. Pricing errors from moderate nonlinearity can be large, and a version of a test for nonlinearity based on risk premiums rather than pricing errors has reasonable power properties after properly controlling for the size of the test. We conclude by examining the importance of moderate nonlinearity in the context of the investment-specific technology shock models of Papanikolaou (2011) and Kogan and Papanikolaou (2014).</description><author>Brandt, Michael W.; Chapman, David A.</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Mar 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>A Mechanism for LIBOR</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Coulter, Brian; Shapiro, Joel; Zimmerman, Peter
The investigations into the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) have highlighted that it is subject to manipulation. We examine a new method for constructing LIBOR that produces an unbiased estimator of the true rate. LIBOR itself is based solely on transactions. We allow for fines when a bank's transaction is different than a comparison rate, which depends on the set of transactions and non-manipulated rates elicited by a revealed preference mechanism. These non-manipulated rates will always be used in the fines, but transactions may not. We address how this approach applies to potential replacements for LIBOR and other financial benchmarks, and how it works even in markets in which there are few transactions.</description><author>Coulter, Brian; Shapiro, Joel; Zimmerman, Peter</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Mar 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Dynamic Dependence and Diversification in Corporate Credit</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Christoffersen, Peter; Jacobs, Kris; Jin, Xisong; Langlois, Hugues
We characterize dependence in corporate credit and equity returns for 215 firms using a new class of large-scale dynamic copula models. Copula dependence and especially tail dependence are highly variable and persistent, increase significantly in the financial crisis, and have remained high since. The most drastic increases in credit dependence occur in July/August of 2007 and in August of 2011 and the decrease in diversification potential caused by the increases in dependence and tail dependence is large. Credit default swap correlation dynamics are important determinants of credit spreads.</description><author>Christoffersen, Peter; Jacobs, Kris; Jin, Xisong; Langlois, Hugues</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Mar 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>What Drives Index Options Exposures?</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Johnson, Timothy; Liang, Mo; Liu, Yun
This paper documents the history of aggregate positions in US index options and investigates the driving factors behind use of this class of derivatives. We construct several measures of the magnitude of the market and characterize their level, trend, and covariates. Measured in terms of volatility exposure, the market is economically small, but it embeds a significant latent exposure to large price changes. Out-of-the-money puts are the dominant component of open positions. Variation in options use is well described by a stochastic trend driven by equity market activity and a significant negative response to increases in risk. Using a rich collection of uncertainty proxies, we distinguish distinct responses to exogenous macroeconomic risk, risk aversion, differences of opinion, and disaster risk. The results are consistent with the view that the primary function of index options is the transfer of unspanned crash risk.</description><author>Johnson, Timothy; Liang, Mo; Liu, Yun</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Mar 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Equilibrium with Monoline and Multiline Structures</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Ibragimov, Rustam; Jaffee, Dwight; Walden, Johan
We study a competitive market for risk-sharing, in which risk-tolerant providers of risk protection, who face frictional costs in holding capital, offer coverage over a range of risk classes to risk-averse agents. We distinguish monoline and multiline industry structures and characterize when each structure is optimal. Markets for which the risks are limited in number, asymmetric or correlated will be served by monoline structures, whereas markets characterized by a large number of essentially independent risks will be served by many multiline firms. Our results are consistent with observed structures within insurance, and also have general implications for the financial services industry.</description><author>Ibragimov, Rustam; Jaffee, Dwight; Walden, Johan</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Mar 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Why Did Sponsor Banks Rescue Their SIVs? A Signaling Model of Rescues</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Segura, Anatoli
At the beginning of the past financial crisis sponsoring banks rescued their structured investment vehicles (SIVs) despite of lack of contractual obligation to do so. I show that this outcome may arise as the equilibrium of a signaling game between banks and their debt investors when a negative shock affects the correlated asset returns of a fraction of banks and their sponsored vehicles. The rescue is interpreted as a good signal and reduces the refinancing costs of the sponsoring bank. If banks' leverage is high or the negative shock is sizable enough, the equilibrium is a pooling one in which all banks rescue. When the aggregate financial sector is close to insolvency, banks' expected net worth would increase if rescues were banned. The model can be extended to discuss the circumstances in which all banks collapse after rescuing their vehicles.</description><author>Segura, Anatoli</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Mar 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Wages and Human Capital in Finance: International Evidence, 1970-2011</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Boustanifar, Hamid; Grant, Everett; Reshef, Ariell
We study the allocation and compensation of human capital in the finance industry in a set of developed economies in 1970-2011. Finance relative wages generally increase-but not in all countries, and to varying degrees. Trading-related activities account for 50% of the increases, despite accounting for only 13% of finance employment, on average. Financial deregulation is the most important factor driving up wages in finance; it has a larger effect in environments where informational rents and socially inefficient risk taking are likely to be prevalent. Differential investment in information and communication technology does not have causal explanatory power. High finance wages attract skilled international immigration to finance, raising concerns for "brain drain."</description><author>Boustanifar, Hamid; Grant, Everett; Reshef, Ariell</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Mar 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Risk-Based Capital Requirements and Optimal Liquidation in a Stress Scenario</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Braouezec, Yann; Wagalath, Lakshithe
We develop a simple yet realistic framework to analyze the impact of an exogenous shock on a bank's balance-sheet and its optimal response when it is constrained to maintain its risk-based capital ratio above a regulatory threshold. We show that in a stress scenario, capital requirements may force the bank to shrink the size of its assets and we exhibit the bank's optimal strategy as a function of regulatory risk-weights, asset market liquidity, and shock size. When financial markets are perfectly competitive, we show that the bank is always able to restore its capital ratio above the required one. However, for banks constrained to sell their loans at a discount and/or with a positive price impact when selling their marketable assets (large banks) we exhibit situations in which the deleveraging process generates a death spiral. We then show how to calibrate our model using annual reports of banks and study in detail the case of the French bank BNP Paribas. Finally, we suggest how our simple framework can be used to design a systemic capital surcharge.</description><author>Braouezec, Yann; Wagalath, Lakshithe</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Mar 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Trust and Household Debt</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Jiang, Danling; Lim, Sonya S.
Using a large sample of US individuals, we show that individuals with higher levels of trust have lower likelihoods of default in household debt and higher net worth. The effect is driven by trust values inherited from cultural and family backgrounds more than by trust beliefs about others. We demonstrate a causal impact of trust on financial outcomes by extracting the component of trust correlated with early-life experiences. The effect of trust is more pronounced among females, those with lower education, lower income, lower financial literacy, and higher debt-to-income ratio. Further evidence suggests that enhancing individuals' trust, to the right amount, can improve household financial well-being.</description><author>Jiang, Danling; Lim, Sonya S.</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Mar 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Gender Gap in Personal Bankruptcy Risks: Empirical Evidence from Singapore</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Agarwal, Sumit; He, Jia; Sing, Tien Foo; Zhang, Jian
Gender gap can arise due to various factors-socio-economic, culture, risk attitudes, and macro-economic circumstances. Using a unique dataset that merges motor vehicle events with bankruptcy outcomes and personal data from Singapore, this study finds significant evidence of a gender gap in personal bankruptcy risk. We show that women's odds of being involved in bankruptcy events are 28% of those of men after controlling for demographic variables, housing type, cultural and spatial fixed effects. Using motor vehicle accidents as an instrument, we confirm that the gender gap in bankruptcy risk is mainly driven by risk-taking behavior. The heterogeneity analyses show that culture also explains part of the difference.

This paper develops a novel method for classifying oil price changes as supply or demand driven using information in asset prices. Motivated by a simple model, demand shocks are identified as returns to an index of oil producing firms which are orthogonal to unexpected changes in the VIX index, with supply shocks capturing the remaining variation in oil prices. Demand shocks are strongly positively correlated with market returns and economic output, whereas supply shocks have a strong negative correlation. The negative correlation of supply shocks and returns is strongest in industries that produce consumer goods, while the positive correlation of demand shocks is stronger for industries which use relatively large amounts of oil as an input.</description><author>Ready, Robert C.</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Feb 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Growth Option Exercise and Capital Structure</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Purnanandam, Amiyatosh; Rajan, Uday
We document that firms decrease their leverage when they convert growth options into tangible assets. We argue that the act of growth option exercise decreases information asymmetry about the firm, which in turn reduces the relative cost of issuing information-sensitive securities such as equity. We show that leverage is negatively correlated with unexpected capital expenditure, our proxy for growth option conversion. The negative relationship becomes stronger when the information environment of a firm deteriorates following a reduction in analyst coverage after a brokerage house merger. Overall, our findings are contrary to standard trade-off and pecking order theories, but are consistent with recent work on signaling and growth options.</description><author>Purnanandam, Amiyatosh; Rajan, Uday</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Feb 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Investor Redemptions and Fund Manager Sales of Emerging Market Bonds: How Are They Related?</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Shek, Jimmy; Shim, Ilhyock; Shin, Hyun Song
Asset portfolios of open-end mutual funds reflect both the fund flows from ultimate investors as well as discretionary trading by the fund managers. We propose a method for decomposing the change in mutual fund asset holdings into the parts due to investor flows, fund manager discretionary sales, and valuation effects. We find that discretionary sales tend to reinforce the sales due to investor redemptions. We also find that 100 dollars' worth of bond sales is associated with around 4 dollars' worth of valuation losses. Finally, we show that a one percentage point increase in emerging market economy (EME) bond yields is associated with a 9- 10% decline in the dollar value of EME bond fund holdings.</description><author>Shek, Jimmy; Shim, Ilhyock; Shin, Hyun Song</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Feb 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Learning and Leverage Cycles in General Equilibrium: Theory and Evidence</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Hennessy, Christopher A.; Radnaev, Boris
This article develops and empirically tests a tractable general equilibrium model of corporate financing and investment dynamics in a trade-off economy where heterogeneous firms face unobservable disaster risk and engage in rational Bayesian learning. The model sheds light on leverage cycles. During periods absent disasters: equity premia decrease; credit spreads decrease; expected loss-given-default increases; and leverage ratios increase. Time-since-prior-disaster is the key model conditioning variable. In response to a disaster, risk premia increase while firms sharply reduce labor, capital and leverage, with response size increasing in time-since-prior-disasters. Firms with high bankruptcy costs are most responsive to the time-since-disaster variable. Disaster responses are more pronounced than in an otherwise equivalent economy featuring observed disaster risk. Empirical tests of novel corporate finance predictions are conducted. Consistent with the model, we find empirically that leverage and investment are increasing in time-since-prior-recessions, with the effect more pronounced for firms with low recovery ratios.</description><author>Hennessy, Christopher A.; Radnaev, Boris</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Feb 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Risk Premia and Volatilities in a Nonlinear Term Structure Model</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Feldhutter, Peter; Heyerdahl-Larsen, Christian; Illeditsch, Philipp
We introduce a reduced-form term structure model with closed-form solutions for yields where the short rate and market prices of risk are nonlinear functions of Gaussian state variables. The nonlinear model with three factors matches the timevariation in expected excess returns and yield volatilities of US Treasury bonds from 1961 to 2014.

We study a model where some investors ("hedgers") are bad at information processing, while others ("speculators") have superior information-processing ability and trade purely to exploit it. The disclosure of financial information induces a trade externality: if speculators refrain from trading, hedgers do the same, depressing the asset price. Market transparency reinforces this mechanism, by making speculators' trades more visible to hedgers. Hence, issuers will oppose both the disclosure of fundamentals and trading transparency. Issuers may either under-or over-provide information compared to the socially efficient level if speculators have more bargaining power than hedgers, while they never under-provide it otherwise. When hedgers have low financial literacy, forbidding their access to the market may be socially efficient.</description><author>Di Maggio, Marco; Pagano, Marco</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Feb 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>The Capital Structure of Nations</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Bolton, Patrick; Huang, Haizhou
When a nation can finance its investments via foreign-currency denominated debt or domestic-currency claims, what is the optimal capital structure of the nation? Building on the functions of fiat money as both medium of exchange, and store of value like corporate equity, our model connects monetary economics, fiscal theory, and international finance under a unified corporate finance perspective. With frictionless capital markets both a Modigliani-Miller theorem for nations and the classical quantity theory of money hold. With capital market frictions, a nation's optimal capital structure trades off inflation dilution costs and expected default costs on foreign-currency debt. Our framing focuses on the process by which new money claims enter the economy and the potential wealth redistribution costs of inflation.</description><author>Bolton, Patrick; Huang, Haizhou</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Feb 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>ECB Policies Involving Government Bond Purchases: Impact and Channels</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Krishnamurthy, Arvind; Nagel, Stefan; Vissing-Jorgensen, Annette
We evaluate the effects of three European Central Bank (ECB) policies (the Securities Markets Programme (SMP), the Outright Monetary Transactions (OMT), and the LongTerm Refinancing Operations (LTROs)) on government bond yields. We use a novel Kalman-filter augmented event-study approach and yields on euro-denominated sovereign bonds, dollar-denominated sovereign bonds, corporate bonds, and corporate credit default swap (CDS) rates to understand the channels through which policies reduced sovereign bond yields. On average across Italy, Spain and Portugal, considering both the SMP and the OMT, yields fall considerably. Decomposing this fall, default risk accounts for 37% of the reduction in yields, reduced redenomination risk for 13%, and reduced market segmentation effects for 50%. Stock price increases in distressed and core countries suggest that these policies also had beneficial macro-spillovers.</description><author>Krishnamurthy, Arvind; Nagel, Stefan; Vissing-Jorgensen, Annette</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Feb 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Financial Repression in the European Sovereign Debt Crisis</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Becker, Bo; Ivashina, Victoria
At the end of 2013, the share of domestic government debt held by the banking sectors of Eurozone countries was more than twice the amount held in 2007. We show that these increased bond holdings generated a crowding out of corporate lending. We find that the corporate loan supply was depressed by domestic sovereign bonds exclusively during the crisis period (2010-11). The crowding-out pattern holds across firms with different relationship banks within a given country. These findings suggest that sovereign bond holdings negatively impact private capital formation and reflect financial repression. We show that direct government ownership, as well as government influence through banks' boards of directors, is among the channels used to influence banks.</description><author>Becker, Bo; Ivashina, Victoria</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Feb 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Financing Asset Sales and Business Cycles</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Arnold, Marc; Hackbarth, Dirk; Puhan, Tatjana Xenia
Using a dynamic model of financing, investment, and macroeconomic risk, we investigate when firms sell assets to fund investments (financing asset sales) across the business cycle. Equity financed investment transfers wealth from equity to debt because asset volatility declines and earnings increase when firms invest. Financing asset sales reduce asset collateral and, hence, transfer wealth back from debt to equity. Exploring the dynamics of the heretofore overlooked "asset sale versus external equity" financing margin across business cycles helps explain novel stylized facts about asset sales and their business cycle patterns that cannot be rationalized by traditional motives for selling assets.</description><author>Arnold, Marc; Hackbarth, Dirk; Puhan, Tatjana Xenia</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Feb 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Emotional State and Market Behavior</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Breaban, Adriana; Noussair, Charles N.

To track traders' emotions in real time, we analyze participants' facial expressions with facereading software before and while the market is operating. We find that a positive emotional state correlates with purchases and overpricing. Fear correlates with selling, low prices, and price decreases.

We empirically reinvestigate the issue of the excess co-movement of commodity prices initially raised in Pindyck and Rotemberg (1990). Excess co-movement appears when commodity prices remain correlated even after adjusting for the impact of fundamentals. We use recent developments in large approximate factor models to consider a richer information set and adequately model these fundamentals. We consider a set of eight unrelated commodities along with 184 real and nominal macroeconomic variables, from developed and emerging economies, from which nine factors are extracted over the 1993-2013 period. Our estimates provide evidence of time-varying excess co-movement which is particularly high after 2007. We further show that speculative intensity is a driver of the estimated excess comovement, as speculative trading is both correlated across the commodity futures markets and correlated with the futures prices. Our results can be taken as direct evidence of the significant impact of financialization on commodity-price crossmoments.

We measure credit risk premia-prices for bearing corporate default risk in excess of expected default losses-using Markit CDS and Moody's Analytics EDF data. We find dramatic variation over time in credit risk premia, with peaks in 2002, during the global financial crisis of 2008-09, and in the second half of 2011. Even after normalizing these premia by expected default losses, median credit risk premia fluctuate over time by more than a factor of 10. Credit risk premia comove with macroeconomic indicators, even after controlling for variation in expected default losses, with higher premia per unit of expected loss during times of market-wide distress. Countercyclical variation of premia-to-expected-loss ratios is more pronounced for investment-grade issuers than for high-yield issuers.</description><author>Berndt, Antje; Douglas, Rohan; Duffie, Darrell; Ferguson, Mark</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Mar 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Do Exposures to Sagging Real Estate, Subprime, or Conduits Abroad Lead to Contraction and Flight to Quality in Bank Lending at Home?</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Ongena, Steven; Tumer-Alkan, Gunseli; von Westernhagen, Natalja

The literature on international equity holdings distinguishes between home bias (over-weighting of home stocks) and foreign bias (relative underweighting for more "distant" countries). The two biases can be integrated into one distance-based model. We define pure home bias as the excess of home bias relative to this model, and find pure home bias only in emerging markets. Countries with high tax rates and low credit standing have higher pure home bias, and more development comes with lower distance aversion. Methodologically, the choice of portfolio bias measure matters.

A given investor's portfolio can exhibit highly disperse holdings-e.g., portfolio weights may vary significantly from market capitalization weights. Our model also generates large ranges of asset prices due to information asymmetries.

We investigate the trading of corporate bonds (c-bonds) by an open limit order book (LOB) mechanism. To do so, we use the case of the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange (TASE) as a laboratory, in which both stocks and c-bonds are traded by an LOB mechanism. Contrary to the OTC market in the USA, the TASE c-bond market is liquid with narrow spreads and low price dispersion. The short-term traders (STT), who are the analog of the market makers in the LOB, have small trading rents and unconcentrated activity (a low Herfindahl index). In the cross-section of bonds, the low concentration is related to low spreads, low price dispersion, and small STT rents. The non-STT [including retail investors (RIs), whose participation is significant] competes with the STT on quotation and tends to tighter quotes. RIs' activity contributes to narrower spreads.</description><author>Abudy, Menachem; Wohl, Avi</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jul 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>The Effects of Investment Bank Rankings: Evidence from M&amp;A League Tables</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Derrien, Francois; Dessaint, Olivier
This paper explores how league tables, which are rankings based on market shares, influence the mergers and acquisitions market. A bank's league table rank predicts its future deal flow, above and beyond other determinants. This creates incentives for banks to manage their league table ranks. League table management tools include selling fairness opinions (FOs) and reducing fees. Banks use such tools mostly when their incentives to do so are high: when a transaction affects their league table position or when they lost ranks in recent league tables. League table management seems to affect the quality of FOs.</description><author>Derrien, Francois; Dessaint, Olivier</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jul 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Liquidity Flows in Interbank Networks</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Castiglionesi, Fabio; Eboli, Mario
This article characterizes the interbank deposit network as a flow network that is able to channel liquidity flows among banks. These flows are beneficial, allowing banks to cope with liquidity risk. First, we analyze the efficiency of three network structures: star-shaped, complete, and incomplete in transferring liquidity among banks. The star-shaped interbank network achieves the complete coverage of liquidity risk with the smallest amount of interbank deposits held by each bank. This result implies that the star-shaped network is most resilient to systemic risk. Second, we analyze the banks' decentralized interbank deposit decisions for a given network structure. We show that all network structures can generate an inefficiently low amount of interbank deposits. However, the star-shaped network induces banks to hold an amount of interbank deposits that is the closest to the efficient level. These results provide a rationale for consistent empirical evidence on sparse and centralized interbank networks.</description><author>Castiglionesi, Fabio; Eboli, Mario</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jul 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Labor Representation in Governance as an Insurance Mechanism</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Kim, E.

Results based on German establishment-level data show that skilled employees of firms with 50% labor representation on boards are protected against layoffs during adverse industry shocks. They pay an insurance premium of 3.3% in the form of lower wages. Unskilled blue-collar workers are unprotected against shocks.

Complex mortgages became a popular borrowing instrument during the bullish housing market of the early 2000s but vanished rapidly during the subsequent downturn. These non-traditional loans, including interest-only and negative-amortization mortgages, enable households to postpone loan repayment in contrast to fully amortizing traditional mortgages. Contrary to common perception, complex mortgages are used by households with high-income levels and prime credit scores, quite unlike the low-income population targeted by subprime mortgages. Nonetheless, we find that complex-mortgage borrowers become delinquent on their mortgages at rates twice as high as borrowers with plain-vanilla fixed-rate contracts even after controlling for household and loan characteristics. Our findings suggest a link between innovations in mortgage markets focused on prime borrowers and the financial crisis.</description><author>Amromin, Gene; Huang, Jennifer; Sialm, Clemens; Zhong, Edward</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Oct 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Who Wins When Exchanges Compete?

In contrast with most past models of bids as valuation signals, every bidder has the opportunity to signal and increase the bid by a jump. Jumps communicate bidders' information rapidly, leading to contests that are completed in a few bids. The model additionally predicts; informative delays in the start of bidding; that the probability of a second bid decreases in, and the jump increases in, the first bid; that objects are sold to the highest valuation bidder; and that revenue and efficiency relationships between different auctions hold asymptotically.</description><author>Daniel, Kent D.; Hirshleifer, David</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Aug 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Combination Return Forecasts and Portfolio Allocation with the Cross-Section of Book-to-Market Ratios</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Detzel, Andrew; Strauss, Jack

Using data on actively managed US equity mutual funds, we find that if neither mechanism is operating, winner funds (top-decile ranked in previous year) continue to significantly outperform loser funds (bottom-decile ranked in previous year) by 4.08 percentage points per annum. However, the difference between previous winner and loser funds declines to zero within one year if the two mechanisms are acting together. Thus, equity mutual fund out- and underperformance are unlikely to persist in well-functioning financial markets.</description><author>Bessler, Wolfgang; Blake, David; Luckoff, Peter; Tonks, Ian</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Aug 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Do FOMC Actions Speak Loudly? Evidence from Corporate Bond Credit Spreads</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Javadi, Siamak; Nejadmalayeri, Ali; Krehbiel, Timothy L.
We find that Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) actions (especially rate cuts) narrowed corporate credit spreads during the pre-crisis period of 2002-07. During the 2008 crisis period, we find that both conventional cuts and quantitative easing decreased spreads. But FOMC inactions caused significant widening of spreads. The effects are especially large for speculative-grade and short-maturity bonds. Overall, the policy uncertainty during the crisis and macroeconomic theories during the pre-crisis period help to explain why FOMC announcements impacted credit spreads. The Fed's actions targeted at promoting growth and/or providing systemic liquidity were especially noted by the corporate bond market.</description><author>Javadi, Siamak; Nejadmalayeri, Ali; Krehbiel, Timothy L.</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Aug 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Skewness, Individual Investor Preference, and the Cross-section of Stock Returns</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Lin, Tse-Chun; Liu, Xin
We find a robust negative relation between skewness/lottery-like features, proxied by maximum return (MAX) over the last month, and future returns for stocks preferred by individual investors. This negative relation is nonexistent for the rest of stocks. We identify stocks preferred by individual investors through bundling ten stock characteristics associated with their stock preferences. The negative relation between MAX and future return is produced by the stocks preferred by individuals that account for less than 5% of the overall market capitalization. Our results are robust to alternative definitions of MAX and lottery-like features such as total, idiosyncratic, and expected skewness.</description><author>Lin, Tse-Chun; Liu, Xin</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Aug 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Shareholder Conflicts and Dividends</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Berzins, Janis; Bohren, Oyvind; Stacescu, Bogdan
We examine how dividend policy is used to mitigate potential conflicts of interest between majority and minority shareholders in private Norwegian firms. The average payout is 50% higher if the majority shareholder's equity stake is 55% (high conflict potential) rather than 95% (low conflict potential). Such minority-friendly payout is also associated with higher subsequent minority shareholder investment. These results suggest that controlling shareholders voluntarily use dividends to reduce agency conflicts and build trust, rather than opportunistically preferring private benefits to dividends.

Usual measures of the risk-taking incentives of bank CEOs do not capture the risk-shifting incentives that the exposure of a CEO's wealth to his firm's stock price (delta) creates in highly levered firms.

Previous research documents differences in trading desk skills across management companies that result in significant variation in execution costs. In this paper, we utilize links between management companies and their institutional clients to explore variation in execution costs within management companies. For a subset of management companies, we find that systematic differences in execution costs exist across clients; these differences are comparable to the variation documented across management companies and persist over time. Clients who receive lower execution costs reward management companies with an increase in dollar trading volume. We find no evidence that the results are driven by broker commissions or differences in trading practices. Given the economic significance of our findings and implications for institutional investors, this aspect of execution should be recognized regardless of the ultimate source of the differences.</description><author>Ben-Rephael, Azi; Israelsen, Ryan D.</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Aug 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Indirect Costs of Financial Distress and Bankruptcy Law: Evidence from Trade Credit and Sales</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Sautner, Zacharias; Vladimirov, Vladimir

Consistent with these predictions, we find that when debt enforcement is stronger, financially distressed firms are less exposed to indirect distress costs in the form of reduced access to trade credit and forgone sales.

We show that exported products exit the US market sooner if they stand far away from the exporting country's comparative advantage.

We investigate whether acquiring more primary education has long-term effects on risk-taking behavior in financial markets. Using exogenous variation in education from a compulsory schooling change combined with wealth data for the Swedish population, we estimate the effect of education on stock market participation and on the share of financial wealth invested in stocks, conditional on participation. For men, an extra year of education increases market participation by two percentage points and the share of financial wealth allocated to stocks by 10%. We find suggestive evidence that greater financial wealth is a potential channel through which education increases participation, consistent with the existence of fixed costs. Lower risk aversion is a potential channel through which education increases the stock share. The reform has less effect on female schooling attainment and there is no evidence that this additional education affects women's asset allocation. There is no evidence of spillovers to children.</description><author>Black, Sandra E.; Devereux, Paul J.; Lundborg, Petter; Majlesi, Kaveh</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 May 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>The Cost of Political Connections</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Bertrand, Marianne; Kramarz, Francis; Schoar, Antoinette; Thesmar, David

We find the confluence of CEO-same industry experience makes independent directors particularly helpful in enhancing value-added growth and we identify a channel: guidance toward higher value-added R&amp;D investments and higher quality innovations. Further corroborating these inferences, we find greater improvement in value-added growth when (1) independent directors with industry-CEO experience (IDICEs) have experience in more similar industries; (2) they create more shareholder value as CEO; and (3) they are current CEOs. In addition, IDICEs contribute to value-added growth most when firm environments and characteristics are conducive for active board-management interaction; namely, when product markets are more competitive and dynamic, when outsiders can more easily acquire firm-specific information, and when firms are younger and smaller. Consistent with our inferences on how IDICEs contribute to value-added growth, firms growing faster, less successfully innovating, and/or under strong governance tend to be matched with IDICEs.</description><author>Kang, Shinwoo; Kim, E.

In this respect, the 15-year Japanese floating (JF)-rate bond market, characterized by the lack of diversity among highly leveraged trading strategies, is an ideal case for investigation. A clean measure of market liquidity, liquidity discount rate (LDR), is estimated from JF prices and the LDR is found to be intertwined with funding liquidity only during the crisis. The deterioration of funding liquidity precedes that of the LDR, thus providing evidence of the outbreak of liquidity spiral.</description><author>Chung, Ji-Yeong; Ahn, Dong-Hyun; Baek, In-Seok; Kang, Kyu Ho</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 May 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Option Listing and Information Asymmetry</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Hu, Jianfeng

The standard measures of distress risk ignore the fact that firm defaults are correlated and that some defaults are more likely to occur in bad times. We use risk premium computed from corporate credit spreads to measure a firm's exposure to systematic variation in default risk. Unlike previously used measures, the credit risk premium explicitly accounts for the non-diversifiable component of distress risk. In contrast to prior findings in the literature, we find that stocks with higher systematic default risk exposures have higher expected equity returns which are largely explained by the Fama-French risk factors. We confirm the robustness of these results by using an alternative systematic default risk factor for firms that do not have bonds outstanding.</description><author>Anginer, Deniz; Yildizhan, Celim</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Mar 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>The Dynamics of Tobin's Q</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Puopolo, Giovanni W.

Compensation regulation prevents overinvestment in strategies that increase risk, but it is ineffective in preventing underinvestment in strategies that reduce risk. The regulator optimally combines compensation and capital regulations. In contrast, if the board delegates the choice of strategy to the CEO, compensation regulation is sufficient to prevent both types of risk shifting. Compensation regulation increases shareholders' incentives to implement an active board, which reduces the effectiveness of compensation regulation.</description><author>Kolm, Julian; Laux, Christian; Loranth, Gyoengyi</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Sep 2017 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Taxable and Tax-Deferred Investing with the Limited Use of Losses</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Fischer, Marcel; Gallmeyer, Michael

Our model also helps us rationalize the universal use of at-the-money options when the tax code is taken into account.

Recent evidence on state-dependent variations in market liquidity suggests strong variations in the illiquidity premium across economic states. Adopting a two-state Markov switching model, we find that, while illiquid stocks are affected more by economic conditions than liquid ones are during recessions, the differences in expected returns are relatively small during expansions. Therefore, the expected illiquidity premium displays strong state-dependent variations that are countercyclical. We show that the state of a high illiquidity premium is closely associated with periods of real economic recessions, market declines, and high volatility, which coincides with major events of liquidity dry-up and high liquidity commonality.</description><author>Jang, Jeewon; Kang, Jangkoo; Lee, Changjun</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Oct 2017 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>A Simple Skewed Distribution with Asset Pricing Applications*</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>de Roon, Frans; Karehnke, Paul
Recent research has identified skewness and downside risk as one of the most important features of risk. We present a new distribution which makes modeling skewed risks no more difficult than normally distributed (symmetric) risks. Our distribution is a combination of the "downside" and "upside" half of two normal distributions, and its parameters can be calculated in closed form to match a given mean, variance, and skewness. Value at risk, expected shortfall, portfolio weights, and risk premia have simple expressions for our distribution and show economically meaningful deviations from the normal case already for very modest levels of skewness. An empirical application suggests that our distribution fits the data well.</description><author>de Roon, Frans; Karehnke, Paul</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Oct 2017 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Bank Exposures and Sovereign Stress Transmission*</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Altavilla, Carlo; Pagano, Marco; Simonelli, Saverio
Using novel monthly data for 226 euro-area banks from 2007 to 2015, we investigate the determinants of banks' sovereign exposures and their effects on lending during and after the crisis. Public, bailed-out and poorly capitalized banks responded to sovereign stress by purchasing domestic public debt more than other banks, consistent with both the "moral suasion" and the "carry trade" hypothesis. Public banks' purchases grew especially in coincidence with the largest ECB liquidity injections, which therefore reinforced the "moral suasion" mechanism. Bank exposures significantly amplified the impact of sovereign stress on bank lending to domestic firms, as well as on lending by foreign subsidiaries of stressed-country banks to firms in non-stressed countries. Altogether, our evidence connects this amplification effect and its cross-border transmission to the moral suasion exerted by domestic governments on banks during the crisis.</description><author>Altavilla, Carlo; Pagano, Marco; Simonelli, Saverio</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Oct 2017 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Global Banking: Recent Developments and Insights from Research</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Claessens, Stijn
Following recent crises, cross-border capital flows have declined considerably, and many advanced countries' banks are retrenching. At the same time, banks from emerging and developing countries continue to expand abroad, and banking has become more regional. Research highlights that long-term debt flows are less volatile and that foreign banks with larger presence, more domestic funding, and closer relationships provide more finance and share risks better. While ongoing changes in global banking influence its overall benefits, the crises also revealed the need for a consistent framework for supervising and resolving globally active banks, with the European Banking Union an important model.</description><author>Claessens, Stijn</author><pubDate>Sat, 01 Jul 2017 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>What Are the Best Liquidity Proxies for Global Research?</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Fong, Kingsley Y.

Liquidity plays an important role in global research.

We find that: (i) Closing Percent Quoted Spread is the best monthly percent-cost proxy when available, (ii) Amihud, Closing Percent Quoted Spread Impact, LOT Mixed Impact, High-Low Impact, and FHT Impact are tied as the best monthly cost-per-dollar-volume proxy, (iii) the daily version of Closing Percent Quoted Spread is the best daily percent-cost proxy, and (iv) the daily version of Amihud is the best daily cost-per-dollar-volume proxy.</description><author>Fong, Kingsley Y.

This article investigates the influence of financial development on patterns of industrial specialization across China's regions. We find that industrial sectors reliant on access to external finance tend to concentrate in regions with well-developed financial markets. Both foreign direct investment (FDI) and alternative financing channels are shown to play significant roles in shaping patterns of industrial specialization in China. In contrast, proxies for formal financial markets, for example, the banking system and capital markets, have few effects on regional industrial agglomeration. This result remains robust to instrumental variable estimation, alternative model specifications, and controlling for other traditional determinants of regional specialization.</description><author>He, Qing; Xue, Chang; Zhu, Chenqi</author><pubDate>Sat, 01 Jul 2017 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Investment Financing and Financial Development: Evidence from Viet Nam</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>O'Toole, Conor; Newman, Carol
This article explores whether financial development reduces external financing constraints faced by firms, a key channel through which finance impacts economic growth. Using an extensive firm-level dataset from Viet Nam, we use a structural Q model of investment estimated using a generalized method of moments technique. We focus on three aspects of financial development: financial depth, state-owned enterprise (SOE) use of finance and, the degree of market-driven, commercial bank financing in the economy. Our data allow us to measure financial development at the province level, providing rich within-country variation. We find that financial development reduces external financing constraints for firms thus facilitating higher investment activity. Financing constraints are decreasing in credit to the private sector, increasing in the use of finance by SOEs and decreasing in the degree to which finance is allocated on market-terms by commercial banks.</description><author>O'Toole, Conor; Newman, Carol</author><pubDate>Sat, 01 Jul 2017 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Characterizing the Asymmetric Dependence Premium</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Alcock, Jamie; Hatherley, Anthony

Recent years have seen increased demand from institutional investors for passive replication products that track the performance of hedge fund strategies using liquid investable assets such as futures contracts. In practice, linear replication methods suffer from poor tracking performance and high turnover. We propose a model combination approach to index replication that pools information from a diverse set of pre-specified factor models. Compared with existing methods, the pooled clone strategies yield consistently lower tracking errors, generate less severe portfolio drawdowns, and require substantially smaller trading volume. The pooled hedge fund clones also provide economic benefits in a portfolio allocation context.</description><author>O'Doherty, Michael S.; Savin, N.

C.
In this article, we show that when banks increase their use of wholesale funding they shorten the maturity of loans to corporations. This effect appears to be linked to banks' exposure to rollover risk resulting from their increasing use of short-term uninsured funding. Banks that use more wholesale funding shorten both the maturity of newly issued loans and the maturity of their loan portfolios. These results are not present among banks that rely predominantly on insured deposits. The link between wholesale funding and loan maturity is robust, and holds when we include firm-year fixed effects, suggesting that the decline in loan maturity is bank driven. In line with this premise, we find that the slope of the loan yield curve becomes steeper for banks that use more wholesale funding and that borrowers turn to the bond market to raise funding with longer maturity in response to banks' loan maturity shortening.</description><author>Paligorova, Teodora; Santos, Joao A.

We estimate the stock's likelihood of extreme returns by measuring the extent to which the stock's trades are correlated with market-wide and industry-wide trades during normal times, referred to as herding. We find that stocks whose trades herd most with aggregate-level trades experience most negative (positive) returns during market crashes (booms). While herding generates extreme returns in both sides, investors appear to demand compensation for the possibility of extreme low returns. This is the case even when we control for standard asset pricing variables and other tail risk proxies.</description><author>Chung, Y. Peter; Kim, S.

These results suggest that active institutional investors on the supply side play an important role in the return predictability of fees and they not only respond to demand but also price in additional information around earnings news announcements.

In addition, the cash holding effect is strong among stocks with high transaction costs, high short selling costs, and large idiosyncratic volatility, indicating that arbitrage on the cash holding effect is costly and risky. In line with the limits-to-arbitrage hypothesis, high costs and risk prevent rational investors from exploiting the cash holding effect.</description><author>Li, Xiafei; Luo, Di</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Oct 2017 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Does Financial Stability Matter to the Fed in Setting US Monetary Policy?*</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Oet, Mikhail V.; Lyytinen, Kalle
The Taylor rule presents a traditional approach to guiding and evaluating contemporary monetary policy as a function of inflation and economic slack. While the responsibilities of the Federal Reserve (Fed) include price stability and long-run growth, its mission has grown to include financial stability. Surprisingly, the question of whether financial stability ought to be considered as an element of monetary policy is hotly contested. This study aims to determine whether policymakers' discussions of financial stability and other factors systematically explain deviations of observed policy rates from the rates implied by the Taylor rule. To this end, we conduct content analysis of the Fed's monetary policy discussions to discover actual topics that enter into policy. We offer two main findings: First, discussion themes extracted from released Federal OpenMarket Committee meeting minutes provide explanatory power beyond standard Taylor rule variables. Second, additional explanatory power is provided by a tri-mandate policy rule that accounts for changes in the economic and financial system as moderated by the evolving preferences of the policymakers. We show that a discussion-based thematic model with financial stability dominates Taylor-type rules during normal times. Moreover, the tri-mandate policy model with financial stability dominates Taylor-type rules in zero lower bound conditions. Taken together, these findings reveal that financial stability has mattered to the Fed continuously and remains critical in setting monetary policy in zero lower bound.</description><author>Oet, Mikhail V.; Lyytinen, Kalle</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Mar 2017 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>A Special Issue of the International Risk Management Conference in Warsaw Poland</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Allen, Franklin; Brenner, Menachem

Our estimates based on a panel smooth threshold regression model quantify and explain them: (1) investors have penalized a deterioration of fundamentals more strongly from 2010 to 2012; (2) the higher the bank credit risk, measured with the premium on credit derivatives, the higher the extra premium on fundamentals; (3) after ECB President Draghi's speech in July 2012, it took 1 year to restore the noncrisis regime and suppress the extra premium.</description><author>Delatte, Anne-Laure; Fouquau, Julien; Portes, Richard</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Mar 2017 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Optimal Purchasing of Deferred Income Annuities When Payout Yields are Mean-Reverting*</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Huang, Huaxiong; Milevsky, Moshe A.; Young, Virginia R.
We determine the optimal lifecycle purchasing strategy for deferred income annuities (DIAs)-which are distinct from single- premium income annuities (SPIAs)-for an individual who wishes to maximize the expected utility of his/her annuity income at a fixed time in the future. In contrast to the vast portfolio- choice literature for SPIAs, we focus on the stochasticity of the DIA's payout yield and address concerns that rates are currently "too low" to justify irreversible annuitization. We assume a mean-reverting model for payout yields and show that a risk- neutral consumer who wishes to maximize his/ her expected retirement income should wait until yields reach a threshold- which lies above historical averages-and then purchase the DIA in one lump sum. In contrast, a risk- averse consumer who is concerned the payout yield will remain below average for an extended period and worries about losing mortality credits while waiting, should employ a barrier purchasing strategy, as in the portfolio choice problem under transaction costs. We illustrate how this insight is applied in the context of annuitization. In fact, the optimal behavior of a risk-averse consumer resembles an asymmetric dollar-cost averaging strategy, with a portion of the DIA-budget spent even while payout rates are below historical averages. As part of our analysis we offer an easy-to-use asymptotic approximation for the optimal purchasing strategy (threshold) and provide some numerical examples to illustrate the concept.</description><author>Huang, Huaxiong; Milevsky, Moshe A.; Young, Virginia R.</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Mar 2017 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Investing in Disappearing Anomalies</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Jones, Christopher S.; Pomorski, Lukasz

Using the January effect and short-term index autocorrelations as examples of disappearing anomalies, we find that prolonged decay is empirically important, particularly for small-cap anomalies. Papers that document new anomalies without accounting for such decay may actually underestimate the original strength of the anomaly and imply an overstated level of the anomaly out of sample.

Our empirical tests provide supporting evidence for this negative effect. Moreover, using the passage of the Sarbanes- Oxley Act (SOX) as a quasi- natural experiment, we find that SOX, while strengthening corporate governance, has a negative effect on stock price informativeness, especially among firms with complex organizational structures.</description><author>Gorton, Gary B.; Huang, Lixin; Kang, Qiang</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Mar 2017 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>The Role of Equity Funds in the Financial Crisis Propagation*</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Hau, Harald; Lai, Sandy

Thus, our study is not plagued by the endogeneity problems typically faced by studies on financial advice. We document that advisors hurt trading performance.

This article tests Piotroski and So's (2012) market expectation errors approach to value-growth investing in European equity markets. As in the USA, European value-growth returns are concentrated among firms with existent market expectation errors, but absent among firms without such errors which can be ex ante identified by interacting book-to-market with FSCORE, an accounting-based measure of the firm's fundamental strength. The returns to an expectation errors-based value-growth strategy are highly persistent for up to three years after portfolio formation, pervasive among large firms, and cannot be explained by common risk factors. However, consistent with a mispricing-based interpretation, prior external financing activities significantly influence these market expectation errors. A financing-based misvaluation factor can explain the return behavior of value-growth strategies formed along market expectations errors.</description><author>Walkshaeusl, Christian</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Mar 2017 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Jump and Volatility Dynamics for the S&amp;P 500: Evidence for Infinite-Activity Jumps with Non-Affine Volatility Dynamics from Stock and Option Markets</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Yang, Hanxue; Kanniainen, Juho
Relatively little is known about the empirical performance of infinite-activity Levy jump models, especially with non-affine volatility dynamics.

An extension of the Kroll-Levy simulation experiment shows favorable small-sample properties for data sets of realistic dimensions.

An Analysis of Persistent Crossing in Extremely Segmented Markets</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Atanasov, Vladimir; Merrick, John J.; Schuster, Philipp
We find that small buy trades of US agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) are priced 3-8% lower than large sell trades. No such "crossing" exists in corporate bonds and agency debentures. We attribute the MBS price patterns to impediments to position aggregation in combination with investor suitability rules that disproportionately affect retail-sized trading and show in a model that classic market frictions cannot produce crossing. Our findings imply that valuations placed on securities affected by aggregation and suitability frictions should adjust for position size. Such securities include not only agency MBS, but also asset-backed securities, commercial mortgage-backed securities, collateralized mortgage obligations, collateralized loan obligations, and private-label residential mortgage-backed securities.</description><author>Atanasov, Vladimir; Merrick, John J.; Schuster, Philipp</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Mar 2017 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>The Impact of Security Trading on Corporate Restructurings</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Zachariadis, Konstantinos E.; Olaru, Ioan F.
Hedge funds are heavily involved in corporate restructurings. What makes their involvement distinct from other investors is that hedge funds can trade across the securities of a firm, holding either long or short positions in each security. We analyze the choice of a restructuring proposal by a firm's manager in the presence of a hedge fund as a potential investor in the firm. We show that, under certain market conditions, there is an equilibrium where the firm's manager makes a proposal for which a hedge fund finds it profitable to short-sell the equity of the firm, buy the debt of the firm, and via its debtholdings lead the firm to a value-reducing outcome to gain on its short equity position. The necessary and sufficient market conditions under which the aforementioned equilibrium occurs are that the debt and equity markets are segregated and that other traders in the equity market are net buyers on average.</description><author>Zachariadis, Konstantinos E.; Olaru, Ioan F.</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Mar 2017 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Do Financial Advisors Provide Tangible Benefits for Investors?

Rationality would suggest that advice-seeking investors receive benefits from costly financial advice. However, evidence documenting these benefits for US investors has so far been lacking. This article is the first to document that US mutual fund investors indeed receive one of the many previously hypothesized benefits associated with financial advice. The documented benefit comes from valuable tax-management advice that helps investors avoid taxable fund distributions and becomes even more valuable when investors face distributions that can cause large and hard-to-predict tax liabilities. Additional evidence suggests that financial advice helps with other aspects of tax management such as tax-loss selling.</description><author>Cici, Gjergji; Kempf, Alexander; Sorhage, Christoph</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Mar 2017 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Fooled by Randomness: Investor Perception of Fund Manager Skill</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Heuer, Justus; Merkle, Christoph; Weber, Martin
Return-chasing investors almost exclusively consider top-performing funds for their investment decisions. When drawing conclusions about the managerial skill of these top performers, they tend to neglect fund volatility and the cross-sectional information contained in the number of funds and the distribution of skill. In multiple surveys of sophisticated retail investors, we show that they do not fully understand the role of chance in experimental samples of fund populations. Respondents evaluate each fund in isolation and do not sufficiently account for fund volatility. They confuse risk taking with manager skill and are thus likely to over-allocate capital to lucky past winners.</description><author>Heuer, Justus; Merkle, Christoph; Weber, Martin</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Mar 2017 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>The Role of Speculative Trade in Market Efficiency: Evidence from a Betting Exchange</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Brown, Alasdair; Yang, Fuyu

The stocks in a momentum portfolio, which contribute to momentum profits, do not experience significant subsequent reversals. Conversely, stocks that do not contribute to momentum profits over the intermediate horizon exhibit subsequent reversals. Merging these separate securities into a single portfolio causes momentum and reversal patterns to appear linked. Stocks with momentum can be separated from those that exhibit reversal by sorting on size and book-to-market equity ratio.

Most existing macro-finance term structure models (MTSMs) appear incompatible with regression evidence of unspanned macro risk. This "spanning puzzle" appears to invalidate those models in favor of new unspanned MTSMs. However, our empirical analysis supports the previous spanned models. Using simulations to investigate the spanning implications of MTSMs, we show that a canonical spanned model is consistent with the regression evidence; thus, we resolve the spanning puzzle. In addition, direct likelihood-ratio tests find that the knife-edge restrictions of unspanned models are rejected with high statistical significance, though these restrictions have only small effects on cross-sectional fit and estimated term premia.</description><author>Bauer, Michael D.; Rudebusch, Glenn D.</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Mar 2017 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Credit Ratings Across Asset Classes: A Long-Term Perspective</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Cornaggia, Jess N.; Cornaggia, Kimberly J.; Hund, John E.
We test whether ratings are comparable across asset classes. We examine default rates by initial rating, accuracy ratios, migration metrics, instantaneous upgrade and downgrade intensities, and rating changes over bonds' lives in multivariate regressions. These approaches reveal substantial and persistent differences across broad asset classes, as well as across subcategories of structured finance products. Our results are best explained by variation in rating agency incentives and variation in underlying risk profiles. We conclude that regulations requiring ratings to perform comparably across asset classes will prove difficult to enforce. We advocate instead a regulatory framework that better distinguishes risks and incentives across asset classes.</description><author>Cornaggia, Jess N.; Cornaggia, Kimberly J.; Hund, John E.</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Mar 2017 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Bank Market Power and Firm Performance*</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Delis, Manthos D.; Kokas, Sotirios; Ongena, Steven
Does market power of banks affect firm performance? To answer this question we examine 25,236 syndicated loan facilities granted between 2000 and 2010 by 296 banks to 9,029 US non-financial firms. Accounting for both observed and unobserved bank and firm heterogeneity, we find that firms that were recently poorly performing obtain loans from banks with more market power. However, in the year after loan origination market power positively affects firm performance, but only if it is not too high. Our estimates thus suggest that bank market power can facilitate access to credit by poorly performing firms, yet at the same time also boosts the performance of the firms that obtain credit.</description><author>Delis, Manthos D.; Kokas, Sotirios; Ongena, Steven</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Mar 2017 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Reference-Dependent Preferences and the Empirical Pricing Kernel Puzzle*</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Grith, Maria; Hardle, Wolfgang K.; Kratschmer, Volker

The first one studies different sources of systemic risk in isolation, uses confidential data, and inspires targeted but complex regulatory tools. The second approach uses market data to produce global measures which are not directly connected to any particular theory, but could support a more efficient regulation.

We empirically investigate the effect that relationship lending has on the availability and pricing of interbank liquidity. Our analysis is based on a daily panel of unsecured overnight loans between 1,079 distinct German bank pairs from March 2006 to November 2007, a period that includes the 2007 liquidity crisis that marked the beginning of the 2007-08 global financial crisis. We find that (i) relationship lenders are more likely to provide liquidity to their closest borrowers, (ii) particularly opaque borrowers obtain liquidity at lower rates when borrowing from their relationship lenders, and (iii) during the crisis, relationship lenders provided cheaper loans to their closest borrowers. Our results hold after controlling for search frictions as well as a large set of (time-varying) bank and bank-pair control variables and fixed effects. While we find some indication that lending relationships help banks reduce search frictions in the over-the-counter interbank market, our results establish that bank-pair relationships have a significant impact on interbank credit availability and pricing due to mitigating uncertainty about counterparty credit quality.</description><author>Brauning, Falk; Fecht, Falko</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Mar 2017 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Corporate Governance and Blockchains*</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Yermack, David

Variation in the composition of the defaulted debt pool and credit conditions at the time of default generate time variation in the distribution of recoveries on defaulted debt, and the related distribution of losses on portfolios of credit sensitive debt. We quantify the importance of accounting for such time variation in out-of-sample comparisons of alternative approaches to forecasting recoveries or losses given default (LGD) on defaulted bonds. Using simulations of losses on defaultable bond portfolios, we show that conditional mixture models improve forecasts of expected credit losses through capturing time variation in the recovery/LGD distribution. However, the best forecasts of instrument or firm-level recovery/LGD do not necessarily provide the best forecasts of portfolio-level losses, as the latter depend on the association between errors in the default and recovery/LGD forecasts. Our systematic comparisons of cross-sectional and intertemporal forecasting performance are enabled by a fast maximum-likelihood approach to estimating conditional mixtures of distributions.</description><author>Kalotay, Egon A.; Altman, Edward I.</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Mar 2017 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Managerial Performance Incentives and Firm Risk during Economic Expansions and Recessions</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Savaser, Tanseli; Sisli-Ciamarra, Elif

We also show that the same conditions determine whether recovery works in practice, when the continuous problem is approximated on a bounded or discrete domain without further specification of boundary conditions.

In the quarter after hire, market and balance sheet measures of firm risk decrease significantly and measures of risk management activity increase, especially for hires from prudential regulators, who directly monitor financial firm risk. The absence of this result for unregulated firms and for exogenous shocks to regulatory experience suggests that firms hire ex-employees of their regulators when they perceive a need to reduce risk, consistent with a schooling hypothesis.

We present a model in which flat (state-independent) capital requirements are undesirable because of shocks to bank capital. There is a rationale for countercyclical capital requirements that impose lower capital demands when aggregate bank capital is low. However, such capital requirements also have a cost as they increase systemic risk taking: by insulating banks against aggregate shocks (but not bankspecific ones), they create incentives to invest in correlated activities. As a result, the economy's sensitivity to shocks increases and systemic crises can become more likely. Capital requirements that directly incentivize banks to become less correlated dominate countercyclical policies as they reduce both systemic risk-taking and cyclicality.</description><author>Horvath, Balint L.; Wagner, Wolf</author><pubDate>Sat, 01 Jul 2017 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Cross-Ownership: A Device for Management Entrenchment?</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Levy, Marc; Szafarz, Ariane

Welfare analysis reveals that education, while positive for consumers who learn to make better financial decisions, imposes a negative externality on other consumers when banks respond by setting higher prices.

The cross-sectional "hedging" risk prices are economically consistent with the direction of long-horizon predictability.

We study the impact of banks' market power on the incidence of a bank levy that is imposed on balance sheets. Within the framework of an oligopolistic version of the Monti-Klein model, the pass-through of a bank tax levied on loans is stronger when elasticity of credit demand is low. To test this hypothesis, we investigate the incidence of the Hungarian bank tax that was introduced in 2010 on banks' assets. This case is well suited for our analysis because the tax rate is much higher for large banks than for small banks, which allows relying on difference-in-difference methodology. In line with model predictions, our estimations show that the tax is likely to be shifted to customers with the smallest demand elasticity, such as households. This result depends on the common trends assumption that is discussed at length.</description><author>Capelle-Blancard, Gunther; Havrylchyk, Olena</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 May 2017 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Bond Variance Risk Premiums</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Choi, Hoyong; Mueller, Philippe; Vedolin, Andrea
This paper studies variance risk premiums in the Treasury market. We first develop a theory to price variance swaps and show that the realized variance can be perfectly replicated by a static position in Treasury futures options and a dynamic position in the underlying. Pricing and hedging is robust even in the underlying jumps. Using a large options panel data set on Treasury futures with different tenors, we report the following findings: First, the term structure of implied variances is downward sloping across maturities and increases in tenors. Moreover, the slope of the term structure is strongly linked to economic activity. Second, returns to the Treasury variance swap are negative and economically large. Shorting a variance swap produces an annualized Sharpe ratio of almost two and the associated returns cannot be explained by standard risk factors. Finally, the returns remain highly statistically significant even when accounting for transaction costs and margin requirements.</description><author>Choi, Hoyong; Mueller, Philippe; Vedolin, Andrea</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 May 2017 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Macro-Finance</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Cochrane, John H.

How does the availability of alternative investment opportunities for banks' depositors affect the reaction of the banking system to aggregate liquidity shocks? And what are the implications, if any, for banking regulation? To answer these questions, I study a Diamond-Dybvig environment, where banks hedge against aggregate liquidity risk in the interbank market or default, and depositors borrow and lend in a hidden-bond market. In this framework, banks offer an endogenously incomplete contract, and default in equilibrium only when facing systemic liquidity risk. In this case, the allocation at default is inefficient, and countercyclical liquidity requirements are welfare-improving.</description><author>Panetti, Ettore</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 May 2017 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Microfinance Banks and Financial Inclusion</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Brown, Martin; Guin, Benjamin; Kirschenmann, Karolin
We examine how the geographical proximity to a microfinance bank affects financial inclusion. We study the expansion of the branch network of ProCredit banks in South-East Europe between 2006 and 2010. We report three main findings: First, ProCredit is more likely to open a new branch in areas with a large share of low-income households. Second, in locations where ProCredit opens a new branch the share of banked households increases more than in locations where it does not open a new branch. Third, this increase is particularly strong among low-income households, older households, and households which rely on transfer income.</description><author>Brown, Martin; Guin, Benjamin; Kirschenmann, Karolin</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 May 2016 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Exporters' Exposures to Currencies: Beyond the Loglinear Model</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Boudt, Kris; Liu, Fang; Sercu, Piet
We extend the constant-elasticity regression that is the default choice when equities' exposure to currencies is estimated. In a proper real-option-style model for the exporters' equity exposure to the foreign exchange rate, we argue, the convexity of the relationship implies that the elasticity should depend on the exchange rate level. For instance, it should shrink to zero when the option to export becomes worthless, and that should happen at a critical exchange rate that is still strictly positive. We propose a class of tractable multi-regime regression models featuring, in line with the real-options logic, smooth transitions and within-regime dynamics in the foreign exchange exposure. We then analyze the exchange rate exposure of Chinese exporting firms and find that the model in which the moneyness of the export option has a positive impact on the exchange rate exposure detects a significantly positive and convex exposure for 40% and 65% of the firms depending on whether the market return is included in the regression or not.</description><author>Boudt, Kris; Liu, Fang; Sercu, Piet</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jul 2016 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Sparse Weighted-Norm Minimum Variance Portfolios</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Yen, Yu-Min
We propose to impose a weighted l(1) and squared l(2) norm penalty on the portfolio weights to improve out-of-sample (OOS) performances of portfolio optimization when the number of assets becomes large. We show that under certain conditions, the realized risk of the optimal minimum variance portfolio (MVP) obtained from the strategy can asymptotically be lower than those of benchmark portfolios with a high probability. Our theoretical results imply that penalty parameters for the weighted-norm penalty can be specified as a simple function of the number of assets and sample size. With the theoretical results, we also develop an automatic calibration procedure for choosing the penalty parameters. We demonstrate superior OOS performances of the weighted-norm MVP with two real data sets. Finally, we propose several alternative norm penalties and show that their OOS performances are comparable to the weighted-norm strategy.</description><author>Yen, Yu-Min</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 May 2016 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Local Ownership, Crises, and Asset Prices: Evidence from US Mutual Funds</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Giannetti, Mariassunta; Laeven, Luc

Theory predicts rating agencies' incentive conflicts to be stronger in boom periods, leading to biased ratings and a reduced level of rating quality. We investigate this prediction empirically based on three different approaches. First, we show that initial ratings disagree with bond spread levels during boom periods in the way that rating agencies hold a systematically more optimistic view. Second, we reveal that boom bond ratings tend to be more heavily downgraded from an ex post perspective; and, third, we demonstrate that boom ratings are inflated compared with "conflicts-free" benchmark ratings. In several robustness tests we show that the observed "boom bias" does not result from changes in credit-worthiness, adjustments in rating standards, competitive pressure, or market supply, but rather from rating agencies' incentive conflicts.</description><author>Dilly, Mark; Mahlmann, Thomas</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 May 2016 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Making, Buying, and Concurrent Sourcing: Implications for Operating Leverage and Stock Beta</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Lambrecht, Bart M.; Pawlina, Grzegorz; Teixeira, Joao C. A.
We present a real options model of a firm's make-or-buy decision under demand uncertainty. "Making" is subject to decreasing returns to scale, fixed costs, and capital investment. "Buying" happens at a fixed price and requires no investment. Three distinct procurement regimes endogenously arise: buying, making, or concurrent sourcing for, respectively, low, intermediate, and high demand. Capital constraints encourage buying or concurrent sourcing. Operating leverage peaks when the firm switches between buying and making, and it is lowest (and negative) at the switch between making and concurrent sourcing. This non-monotonic pattern mirrors and drives the behavior of the firm's beta.</description><author>Lambrecht, Bart M.; Pawlina, Grzegorz; Teixeira, Joao C.

The sign of the correlation between equity returns and exchange rate returns can be positive or negative in theory. Using data for a broad set of forty-two countries, we find that exchange rate movements are in fact unrelated to differentials in country-level equity returns. Consequently, a trading strategy that invests in countries with the highest expected equity returns and shorts those with the lowest generates substantial returns and Sharpe ratios. These returns partially reflect compensation for global equity volatility risk, but significant excess returns remain after controlling for exposure to standard risk factors.</description><author>Cenedese, Gino; Payne, Richard; Sarno, Lucio; Valente, Giorgio</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 May 2016 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Investor Scale and Performance in Private Equity Investments</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Dyck, A.; Pomorski, L.
We document that defined benefit pension plans with significant holdings in private equity (PE) earn substantially greater returns than plans with small holdings, in both the 1990s and the 2000s. A one standard deviation increase in PE holdings is associated with 4% greater returns per year. Up to one-third of this outperformance comes from lower costs that we link to economizing on costly intermediation by avoiding fund-of-funds and investing directly. The bulk of the outperformance comes from superior gross returns only partially explained by access and experience.

This article studies the empirical relationship between firms' asset growth and idiosyncratic stock return volatility. In the cross-section, firms' idiosyncratic return volatility is V-shaped with respect to their lagged asset growth rates: the volatility is higher for firms with extreme (either high or low) asset growth rates than for firms with moderate growth rates. In the time series, a higher dispersion across firms in asset growth rates predicts a higher average idiosyncratic return volatility. Moreover, the dispersion in asset growth rates has the strongest time series predictive power among alternative explanations of the average idiosyncratic return volatility, such as cash flow volatility and growth options. These findings indicate the importance of nonlinearity in studying the cross-sectional return volatility and provide a new explanation of the idiosyncratic return volatility that is significant in both the cross-section and the time series.</description><author>Song, Zhongzhi</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 May 2016 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Is Tail Risk Priced in Credit Default Swap Premia?</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Meine, Christian; Supper, Hendrik; Weiss, Gregor N.

We show that the propensity of a bank to experience extreme co-movements in its credit default swap (CDS) premia together with the market is priced in the bank's default swap spread during the financial crisis. We measure a bank's CDS tail beta by estimating the upper tail dependence between its default swap spreads and a CDS market index. Our study shows that protection sellers receive a premium for bearing the risk of extreme upward co-movements in default risk. The economic significance of this effect is large yet limited to the recent financial crisis. Banks in the upper quintile of CDS tail beta have spreads that are on average 140 basis points higher than those of banks in the lower CDS tail beta quintile.</description><author>Meine, Christian; Supper, Hendrik; Weiss, Gregor N.

Ample empirical and experimental evidence documents that individuals place greater weight on information gained through personal experience-a phenomenon that Tversky and Kahneman call availability bias. I embed this bias in an overlapping generations equilibrium model in which the period that investors first enter the market establishes the starting point of their experience history. The difference in the individuals' experience leads to heterogeneity among agents and perceived noise trading. The model captures several empirical findings. It explains why returns on high-volume trading days tend to revert. Furthermore, it provides explanations for a high trading volume, a connection between trading volume and volatility, excess volatility, and overreaction and reversal patterns. Consistent with empirical evidence, young investors buy high and sell low, trade frequently, and obtain lower returns. For intraday trading, it predicts a high trading volume around the opening hours, especially for cross-listed stocks.</description><author>Schraeder, Stefanie</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Mar 2016 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Corporate Fraction and the Equilibrium Term Structure of Equity Risk</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Marfe, Roberto

Such a cointegrating relation not only makes dividends riskier in the short run than at medium horizons but also preserves the role of long-run risk: consequently, the model captures both the traditional puzzles, like the high equity premium, as well as the new evidence about the term structure of equity risk.</description><author>Marfe, Roberto</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Mar 2016 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Transparency, Tax Pressure, and Access to Finance</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Ellul, Andrew; Jappelli, Tullio; Pagano, Marco; Panunzi, Fausto
More transparent firms enjoy better access to finance, and also enable closer scrutiny by tax authorities and thus face a heavier tax burden, insofar as they are required to report the same data to tax authorities and investors (book-tax conformity). We study this trade-off in a model with distortionary taxes and finance rationing, and test its predictions on an international dataset. As predicted, firms facing low corporate tax rates choose high transparency, particularly if they are not very dependent on external funding. This result is confirmed by the evidence from statutory tax reforms: reductions of corporate tax rates are followed by increases in firm transparency. Moreover, firms choose higher transparency in countries with high audit quality. Investment is positively correlated with transparency, especially for firms more dependent on external finance. Results are stronger in countries with book-tax conformity.</description><author>Ellul, Andrew; Jappelli, Tullio; Pagano, Marco; Panunzi, Fausto</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Mar 2016 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Financial Sector Reform after the Subprime Crisis: Has Anything Happened?</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Schaefer, Alexander; Schnabel, Isabel; di Mauro, Beatrice Weder

Why is the mere announcement of an open-market share repurchase program, which involves no commitment to purchase shares, regarded as good news by the market? We develop a theoretical model to resolve this puzzle. The model predicts that firms with large underpricing can attract attention from speculators by announcing repurchases, and the subsequent trades from these speculators lead to value corrections. Firms with small underpricing, however, cannot attract attention by announcing repurchases, and these firms have to use costly share repurchases as a value-correcting signal.

Anecdotal and indirect empirical evidence suggest that excitement and market bubbles are intertwined, such that excitement not only arises during bubbles but may also help fuel them. We directly test the impact of excitement on bubbles in a bubble-prone experimental asset-pricing market (Capinalp, Porter, and Smith, 2001). Prior to trading, participants are assigned to emotion inductions through video clips The results of fifty-five markets show larger asset pricing bubbles in magnitude and amplitude in the excitement treatment relative to a treatment of same valence and lower intensity (calm) and a treatment of similar intensity and opposite valence (fear).</description><author>Andrade, Eduardo B.; Odean, Terrance; Lin, Shengle</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Mar 2016 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>The Hidden Peril: The Role of the Condo Loan Market in the Recent Financial Crisis*</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Agarwal, Sumit; Deng, Yongheng; Luo, Chenxi; Qian, Wenlan
This article studies the condominium loan market, which experienced a 15-fold increase in origination and constituted 15% of the overall residential loan originations from 2001 to 2007. Condominium loan defaults grow at a faster rate than single-family (including subprime) loan defaults. Further analysis suggests that the greater default level and growth rate in later loan cohorts are consistent with the investor channel explanation: investor borrowers default more, especially when house prices start to decline. We also show that condo defaults have triggered more defaults of the same cohort subprime mortgages at the same location.</description><author>Agarwal, Sumit; Deng, Yongheng; Luo, Chenxi; Qian, Wenlan</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Mar 2016 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>International Sourcing and Capital Structure*</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Eun, Cheol S.; Wang, Lingling
Motivated by the rising importance of international sourcing by US firms in recent decades, we study the influence of international sourcing on capital structure. We find that international sourcing has a significant negative influence on financial leverage. The negative influence is stronger in industries that have high R&amp;D intensities and are financially constrained. However, the negative relation is mitigated when suppliers are from countries with strong legal environments and when the supplier markets are more competitive. Overall, our findings suggest that relationship-specific investments, supplier market characteristics, and financial market conditions are key determinants of the sourcing-leverage relation.</description><author>Eun, Cheol S.; Wang, Lingling</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Mar 2016 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Corporate Post-Retirement Benefit Plans and Leverage*</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Bartram, Soehnke M.
Defined benefit pension and health care plans are important for firm leverage around the world. While consolidating off-balance sheet post-retirement plans increases effective leverage by 32%, firms reduce their level of regular debt by only 22 cents for every dollar of projected benefit obligation, yielding overall 23% higher total leverage of plan sponsors compared with similar firms without post-retirement plans. The most important driver of substitution rates between regular debt and post-retirement obligations is rule of law, followed by labor market freedom and taxes. In contrast, pension guarantee funds and priority of unfunded pension obligations are less important for substitution rates.</description><author>Bartram, Soehnke M.</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Mar 2016 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>ABCs of Trading: Behavioral Biases affect Stock Turnover and Value*</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Itzkowitz, Jennifer; Itzkowitz, Jesse; Rothbort, Scott
Psychological research suggests that individuals are satisficers. That is, when confronted with a large number of options, individuals often choose the first acceptable option, rather than the best possible option (Simon, 1957). Given the vast quantity of information available and the widespread convention of listing stocks in alphabetical order, we conjecture that investors are more likely to buy and sell stocks with early alphabet names. Consistent with this view, we find that early alphabet stocks are traded more frequently than later alphabet stocks and that alphabeticity also affects firm value.

Principal customers have strong incentives to screen and/or monitor suppliers to ensure supply-chain stability; consequently, the implicit certification from the existence of long-term relationships with principal customers has reputational consequences that potentially spill over to other markets. We argue that one such consequence is smaller loan spreads and looser loan covenants on bank loans, as firms that are able to hold on to principal customers longer are perceived as safer firms by banks. We address causality and endogeneity issues via a variety of tests and find consistent results.

This effect is present during both periods of financial stability and of financial distress, and it is smaller in the banking sector than in other sectors. The article's major finding is robust when controlling for potential endogeneity.

However, in long windows, individual stocks' demand and supply elasticities correlate positively.

Regulators and market participants are concerned about leveraged exchange-traded funds (ETFs)' role in driving up end-of-day volatility through hedging activities near the market's close. Leveraged ETF providers counter that the funds are too small to make a meaningful impact on volatility. For the period surrounding the financial crisis, 2006-11, we show that end-of-day volatility was positively and statistically significantly correlated with the ratio of potential rebalancing trades to total trading volume. The impacts were not all economically significant, but largest during the most volatile days.

There is only one source of risk, and the expert is privately informed about the risky asset's volatility. When monetary transfers are unenforceable, we show that investors may delegate their investment decisions to the expert. When doing so, however, they impose restrictions on her choices which crucially depend on whether the expert perceives investors' asset allocations as complements or as substitutes. Finally, we analyze the implications of non-exclusivity in financial advice on investment behavior and welfare, and highlight a set of novel testable implications.</description><author>Piccolo, Salvatore; Puopolo, Giovanni W.; Vasconcelos, Luis</author><pubDate>Sat, 01 Oct 2016 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Optimal Leverage Ratio and Capital Requirements with Limited Regulatory Power</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Wu, Ho-Mou; Zhao, Yue
This article discusses the optimal leverage ratio and capital requirements when asymmetric information exists between the bank and the regulator. We show that the optimal requirements take different forms in the short and long run. In either case, imposing the risk-weighted capital requirement without considering the incentives of the bank to misreport its risk profile is never optimal by itself. In the long run, the optimal requirements take the form of a leverage ratio requirement on top of the risk-weighted capital requirement. The add-on leverage ratio requirement, which serves as a compensation for the limited supervisory power of the regulators, should be set such that the risk-taking behavior of the bank is unchanged from the situation in which the regulator uses the risk-weighted capital requirement alone, and the misreporting incentive of the bank is eliminated by the add-on leverage ratio requirement.</description><author>Wu, Ho-Mou; Zhao, Yue</author><pubDate>Sat, 01 Oct 2016 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Rushing into the American Dream?

This effect is reinforced when trading is used for risk shifting. Overall, combining relationship banking and trading offers benefits under small-scale trading, but distortions may dominate when trading is unbridled.

Even with a cost advantage enjoyed by a supplier and passed on to its customers, in an industry equilibrium of a priori identical firms, only those that use little or no debt outsource their input to the supplier; all significantly debt-financed firms produce their own input and take advantage of the greater profit volatility resulting from internal production.</description><author>Kanatas, George; Qi, Jianping</author><pubDate>Sat, 01 Oct 2016 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>R&amp;D Spillover and Predictable Returns*</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Jiang, Yi; Qian, Yiming; Yao, Tong

Counterparty contagion is greater in cases of riskier firms and larger and more complex exposures. However, the counterparty exposures are small, especially among banks that face diversification regulations, and do not typically cause a cascade of failures. Information contagion is stronger for rivals in the same markets and has a larger impact in cases of distress than in bankruptcies.</description><author>Helwege, Jean; Zhang, Gaiyan</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jul 2016 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>The "CAPS" Prediction System and Stock Market Returns</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Avery, Christopher N.; Chevalier, Judith A.; Zeckhauser, Richard J.

Contrary to one of the main regulatory goals, we find that even though margin requirements restrict borrowing and shorting, they can significantly increase market volatility. In addition, margin requirements can make margin constrained investors better off and can lead to a greater return reversal.

Banks (but not stock markets) promote economic growth by facilitating relationship-specific investment between buyers and suppliers of intermediate goods. Combined insights from literature on signaling role of banks and on relationship-specific investment motivate this economic channel: A supplier is reluctant to undertake relationship-specific investment as she cannot observe financial stability and planning horizon of buyer. Banks can mitigate this information asymmetry. Empirical results from twenty-eight industries in ninety countries confirm that industries dependent on relationship-specific investment from their suppliers grow disproportionately faster in countries with a well-developed banking sector. The channel works via increased entry of new firms and higher capital accumulation.</description><author>Strieborny, Martin; Kukenova, Madina</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jul 2016 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Changing Risk Perception and the Time-Varying Price of Risk</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Fuess, Roland; Gehrig, Thomas; Rindler, Philipp B.

Using a methodology novel to empirical finance, we quantify the increase in credit spreads caused by changes in risk pricing and changes in risk factors. The lasting increase in credit spreads is almost exclusively due to time-varying prices of risk. We interpret this as a change in risk perception which provides a possible solution to the credit spread puzzle. Default premia spiked during the crisis and did not return to their pre-crisis levels.

The estimated model fits the term structure of real rates well, and strongly supports our choice of institutional investors.

We demonstrate that systematic confounding events are critical challenges when testing theories about investors' reactions in finance and management research.</description><author>de Jong, Abe; Naumovska, Ivana</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jul 2016 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>The Real Costs of Financial Efficiency When Some Information Is Soft</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Edmans, Alex; Heinle, Mirko S.; Huang, Chong
This article shows that improving financial efficiency may reduce real efficiency. While the former depends on the total amount of information available, the latter depends on the relative amounts of hard and soft information. Disclosing more hard information (e.g., earnings) increases total information, raising financial efficiency and reducing the cost of capital. However, it induces the manager to prioritize hard information over soft by cutting intangible investment to boost earnings, lowering real efficiency. The optimal level of financial efficiency is non-monotonic in investment opportunities. Even if low financial efficiency is desirable to induce investment, the manager may be unable to commit to it. Optimal government policy may involve upper, not lower, bounds on financial efficiency.</description><author>Edmans, Alex; Heinle, Mirko S.; Huang, Chong</author><pubDate>Sat, 01 Oct 2016 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>The Impact of Liquidity Regulation on Bank Intermediation*</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Bonner, Clemens; Eijffinger, Sylvester C. W.
We analyze the impact of a requirement similar to the Basel III Liquidity Coverage Ratio on the bank intermediation applying Regression Discontinuity Designs. Using a unique dataset on Dutch banks, we show that a liquidity requirement causes long-term borrowing and lending rates as well as demand for long-term interbank loans to increase. Lower levels of aggregate liquidity increase the estimated effects. Short-term borrowing and lending rates only rise during periods of lower market-wide liquidity. Further, banks do not seem able to pass on the increased funding costs in the interbank market to their private sector clients. Rather, a liquidity requirement seems to decrease banks' interest margins.</description><author>Bonner, Clemens; Eijffinger, Sylvester C.

We show that social capital improves the viability of stakeholder-oriented firms operating in competitive markets. Studying exits from the population of Norwegian savings banks after deregulations, we find that banks located in communities with high social capital have a higher probability of survival, but no similar effect exists for commercial banks. Norwegian savings banks are collectively governed by their stakeholders and we provide evidence that social capital improves the efficiency of stakeholder governance. In high social capital areas, banks raise more deposits locally, distribute more of their surplus for altruistic purposes, and operate more locally focused branch networks.</description><author>Ostergaard, Charlotte; Schindele, Ibolya; Vale, Bent</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Aug 2016 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Good Monitoring, Bad Monitoring*</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Grinstein, Yaniv; Rossi, Stefano
Are courts effective monitors of corporate decisions?

In our event study, low-growth Delaware firms outperformed matched non-Delaware firms by 1% in the three day event window. In contrast, high-growth Delaware firms under-performed by 1%.

Using data from Chinese stock markets, we examine the effect of speculative trading on stock returns. We develop a volume-related variable, abnormal turnover ratio (ATR), by isolating speculative trading from liquidity and other components in trading volume. After a group of tests verifying that ATR indeed represents speculative trading, we show that ATR negatively predicts future stock returns. The average monthly return spread between the top and bottom ATR deciles is -1.87%, suggesting a highly significant negative ATR premium. The return predictability of ATR survives after controlling for common risk factors and event-driven information shocks. These findings indicate that speculative trading affects asset prices.</description><author>Pan, Li; Tang, Ya; Xu, Jianguo</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Aug 2016 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>How Do Short-Sale Costs Affect Put Options Trading?

By separating the speculative demand of short sellers from the hedging demand of options market makers in the lending market, our results provide a thorough analysis of the interaction between the options market and the equity lending market.

In a proposed model of a multinational bank, interest margins determine local lending by foreign affiliates and the internal funding by parent banks. We exploit detailed parent-affiliate-level data of all German banks to empirically test our theoretical predictions in pre-crisis times. Local lending by affiliates depends negatively on price margins, the difference between lending and deposit rates in foreign markets. The effect of funding cost margins, the gap between local deposit rates faced by affiliates abroad and the funding costs of their parents, on internal capital market funding is positive but statistically weak. Interest margins are central to explain the interaction between internal capital markets and foreign affiliates lending.</description><author>Galema, Rients; Koetter, Michael; Liesegang, Caroline</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Aug 2016 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>International Firm Investment under Exchange Rate Uncertainty*</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Jeanneret, Alexandre
This article develops a real options theory to examine the effects of exchange rate uncertainty on foreign direct investment. Firms face a choice between participating in foreign markets through exports or investing abroad to relocate production. The model predicts that the most productive firms invest abroad when exchange rate volatility is low and export otherwise, whereas the least productive firms invest abroad when volatility is high. Aggregation over heterogeneous firms produces a negative and nonlinear relation between exchange rate uncertainty and total international investment. An analysis of eighty-four developed and emerging economies over the 1996-2012 period provides empirical support for the model's predictions.</description><author>Jeanneret, Alexandre</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Aug 2016 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Institutions, Bailout Policies, and Bank Loan Contracting: Evidence from Korean Chaebols</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Minetti, Raoul; Yun, Sung-Guan
In emerging economies, institutional and regulatory constraints can distort loan contracting and, hence, the incentives of lenders and borrowers. Studying the South Korean syndicated loan market, we find that during the 90s the safety net protecting business groups (chaebols)-especially the government's bailout policy-affected the structure and pricing of loans to chaebol firms. However, after the chaebol reform of the late 90s dismantled the chaebol safety net, the differences in loan contracts between chaebol and non-chaebol firms narrowed or disappeared. The results suggest that the reform restored lenders' incentives to monitor chaebol firms and properly assess their risk.</description><author>Minetti, Raoul; Yun, Sung-Guan</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Oct 2015 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>An Out-of-Sample Evaluation of Dynamic Portfolio Strategies</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Lan, Chunhua

We argue that, because mature organizations are rationally less flexible, they are more costly to integrate and therefore comparatively unattractive acquisition candidates. The evidence supports this explanation of the negative age dependence of takeover hazard.

Factor implied risk exposures are obtained by breaking down a change in risk disclosure into a market volatility component and a bank-specific risk exposure component. In a study of large US and international banks, we show that (i) changes in risk exposures are negatively correlated with market volatility and (ii) changes in risk exposures are positively correlated across banks, which is consistent with banks exhibiting commonality in trading.</description><author>Benoit, Sylvain; Hurlin, Christophe; Perignon, Christophe</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Oct 2015 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Executive Compensation and Risk Taking</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Bolton, Patrick; Mehran, Hamid; Shapiro, Joel

We propose a model of limited arbitrage based on financial relationships. Financially constrained arbitrageurs may choose to seek additional financing from banks that have the technology to profit from the strategies themselves. A holdup problem arises because banks cannot commit to providing capital. To minimize competition, arbitrageurs will choose to stay constrained and underinvest in the arbitrage unless banks have sufficient reputational capital. This problem arises when mispricing is largest. More competition among financiers, higher arbitrageur wealth, and allowing for explicit contracts can worsen the holdup problem. When arbitrage is risky, financial relationships are more valuable, mitigating the problem.</description><author>Kondo, Jiro E.; Papanikolaou, Dimitris</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Oct 2015 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Stakeholder Governance, Competition, and Firm Value</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Allen, Franklin; Carletti, Elena; Marquez, Robert

Ethical banks, instead, commit to financing only ethical projects, which have social profitability but lower expected revenues. Motivated borrowers are keen to invest in ethical projects and to deal with ethical banks.

Headquarters has private information about the capital productivities of its divisions; therefore, capital allocations in the present serve as a signal to divisional managers about future allocations. To facilitate effort provision, headquarters biases capital allocation so as to not disclose productivity differences across divisions or to credibly signal their absence. The capital allocation bias is time-varying and the relationship between the bias and the difference in average division productivities is inversely U-shaped.</description><author>Hoang, Daniel; Ruckes, Martin</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 May 2015 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Learning about Rare Disasters: Implications For Consumption and Asset Prices</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Gillman, Max; Kejak, Michal; Pakos, Michal

We find that simulated experience considerably improves participants' understanding of the underlying risk-return profile and prompts them to reconsider their investment decisions and to choose riskier financial products without regretting their higher risk-taking behavior afterwards.

Contrary to conventional assumptions, we find that the funding shock works through reduced prospecting-as opposed to tightened lending standards-and leads to fewer loan applications among new applicants in particular, which improves the borrower pool.

Moreover, compared to jump-in-growth models, jump-in-volatility models generate more realistic volatility dynamics and stronger predictability of returns by the variance risk premium.

Against this benchmark, the ELO Bulk Volume Classification (BVC) scheme is inferior to a standard tick rule.

I derive and test multi-horizon implications of a consumption-based equilibrium model featuring fluctuating expected growth and volatility. My setup allows consumption dynamics to be estimated jointly with covariance risk prices in a single-stage generalized method of moment, and then inferences from asset pricing tests reflect uncertainty coming from factor estimation. I show that changes in consumption volatility are the key driver for explaining major asset pricing anomalies across risk horizons, while other factors play no or a secondary role. Value stocks and past long-term losers pay higher average returns mainly because they covary more negatively with these changes than what other stocks do.</description><author>Tedongap, Romeo</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Mar 2015 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Social Engagement and Stock Market Participation*</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Changwony, Frederick K.; Campbell, Kevin; Tabner, Isaac T.
We investigate the separate and joint influences of social engagement measures on stock market participation and find that socially engaged individuals are more likely to participate. Consistent with Granovetter's theory of social networks we find that a weak tie (measured by social group involvement) has a positive effect on stock market participation whereas a strong tie (measured by frequency of talking to neighbors) has no effect. More trusting individuals are more likely to participate in the stock market, as are those who identify with a political party. In contrast, the degree to which religion is important appears to have little impact.</description><author>Changwony, Frederick K.; Campbell, Kevin; Tabner, Isaac T.</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Mar 2015 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Insuring Nonverifiable Losses*</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Doherty, Neil A.; Laux, Christian; Muermann, Alexander
Insurance contracts are often complex and difficult to verify outside the insurance relation.

We model and test for the role of heterogeneously informed, strategic multi-asset speculation for cross-price impact-the impact of trades in one asset on the prices of other (even unrelated) assets-in the U.S. stock market. Our investigation of the trading activity in New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation System (NASDAQ) stocks between 1993 and 2004 reveals that, consistent with our model, (1) daily order imbalance in one industry or random stock has a significant, persistent, and robust impact on daily returns of other (even unrelated) industries or random stocks; (2) cross-price impact is often negative; and (3) both direct (i.e., an asset's own) and absolute (i.e., unsigned) cross-price impact are smaller when speculators are more numerous, greater when market-wide dispersion of beliefs is higher, and greater among stocks dealt by the same specialist.</description><author>Pasquariello, Paolo; Vega, Clara</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Mar 2015 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Depositors' Perception of "Too-Big-to-Fail"*</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Oliveira, Raquel De F.; Schiozer, Rafael F.; Barros, Lucas A.

We exploit the exogenous shock to the Brazilian banking system caused by the international turmoil of 2008 and find evidence that the run to systemically important banks is better explained by the perception of a too-big-to-fail policy than by bank fundamentals. We infer that the extra inflow of deposits received by systemically important banks during crises gives them an important competitive advantage.

The proposed method combines a very effective control variate with conditional Monte Carlo. While the control variate can be used for any model allowing the numerical computation of the multivariate characteristic function of the log-return vector, conditional Monte Carlo is based on the unified representation of the three models.

Regulations in the pre-Sarbanes-Oxley era allowed corporate insiders considerable flexibility in timing their trades and engaging in stealth trading, for example, by executing several trades and reporting them jointly after the last trade. We document that even these lax reporting requirements were frequently violated and stealth trading was common. Event study abnormal returns are larger after reports of stealth trades than after reports of otherwise similar non-stealth trades. Our results imply that delayed reporting impedes the adjustment of prices to the information revealed by insider trades.

Previous studies have identified several variables that would have predicted future stock returns, though other studies suggest these results may be due to data snooping. To guard against data snooping, researchers have suggested use of Bayesian model averaging (BMA) to account for the uncertainty about prediction models. In common with other researchers, I find evidence of predictability during time periods when a hypothetical investor uses BMA with no restrictions on what variables may be included in the model. However, when the hypothetical investor is limited to using only variables whose predictive ability would have been known at the time of the forecast, predictability disappears. Moreover, predictability also disappears when data are updated through 2010, even without constraints on variable use. The results cast doubt on whether stock returns were ever predictable in real time and also suggest that returns may no longer be predictable even if real-time constraints are removed.</description><author>Turner, James A.</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Mar 2015 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Household Portfolio Risk</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Bucciol, Alessandro; Miniaci, Raffaele

Multiple bank lending induces borrowers to take too much debt when creditor rights are poorly protected; moreover, banks wish to engage in opportunistic lending at their competitors' expenses if borrowers' collateral is sufficiently risky. These incentives lead to credit rationing and positive-profit interest rates, possibly exceeding the monopoly level. If banks share information about past debts and seniority via credit reporting systems, the incentive to overborrow is mitigated: interest and default rates decrease; credit access improves if the value of collateral is not very volatile, but worsens otherwise. Recent empirical studies report evidence consistent with these predictions. The article also shows that private and social incentives to share information are not necessarily aligned.</description><author>Bennardo, Alberto; Pagano, Marco; Piccolo, Salvatore</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Mar 2015 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Ending "Too Big To Fail": Government Promises Versus Investor Perceptions</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Gormley, Todd A.; Johnson, Simon; Rhee, Changyong

Our analysis of Korea's 1997-98 crisis suggests an answer: No. Despite a general "no bailout" policy during the crisis, the largest Korean corporate groups-facing severe financial and governance problems-could still borrow heavily from households by issuing bonds at prices implying very low expected default risk. The evidence suggests "too big to fail" beliefs were not eliminated by government promises because investors believed that this policy was not time consistent.

Interestingly, the predictability of stock returns and dividend growth is a tug-of-war contest: when dividend growth is highly predictable in the high-volatility regime, stock returns are largely unpredictable; in contrast, when dividend growth is less predictable in the low-volatility regime, stock returns are significantly predictable. We also investigate macroeconomic determinants of regime switches and find that two regimes are intimately related to macroeconomic risk and economic activity.</description><author>Zhu, Xiaoneng</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Oct 2015 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Herding Behavior and Rating Convergence among Credit Rating Agencies: Evidence from the Subprime Crisis</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Lugo, Stefano; Croce, Annalisa; Faff, Robert

The inverse relation between leverage and profitability is widely regarded as a serious defect of the trade-off theory. We show that the defect is not with the theory but with the use of a leverage ratio in which profitability affects both the numerator and the denominator. Profitability directly increases the value of equity. Firms do take the predicted offsetting actions. They issue debt and repurchase equity when profitability rises, and retire debt and issue equity when profitability falls. Consistent with variable transactions costs, the adjustment is not generally sufficient to fully undo the profitability shocks. Accordingly, on average the leverage ratio falls as profitability rises.</description><author>Frank, Murray Z.; Goyal, Vidhan K.</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jul 2015 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Performance Pay, CEO Dismissal, and the Dual Role of Takeovers</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Burkart, Mike; Raff, Konrad
We propose that an active takeover market provides incentives by offering acquisition opportunities to successful managers. This allows firms to reduce performance-based compensation and can rationalize loss-making acquisitions. When choosing its acquisition policy and the quality of its board, each firm ignores the adverse effect on other firms' acquisition opportunities and takeover threat. As a result, the takeover market is not sufficiently liquid and too few takeovers occur. Furthermore, liquidity in the takeover and managerial labor markets are inversely related. When poaching managers becomes more profitable, firms invest more in board quality which in turn reduces the incidence of takeovers.</description><author>Burkart, Mike; Raff, Konrad</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jul 2015 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>How Much Can Financial Literacy Help?</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Guiso, Luigi; Viviano, Eliana

Successful private equity managers have funds that are often oversubscribed and provide persistent abnormal returns. Why do not successful managers increase fund size or fees? We argue that managers want to attract high-quality entrepreneurs, while entrepreneurs want to match with high-ability managers. However, observing fund performance does not allow entrepreneurs to distinguish a manager's ability from the quality of firms in the fund's portfolio. As a consequence, a fund manager may devote unobserved effort to select firms, and keep fund size small to limit the cost of effort, hoping to manipulate entrepreneurs' beliefs about his ability.</description><author>Marquez, Robert; Nanda, Vikram; Yavuz, M.

This article examines enterprises funded by government-sponsored venture capitalists (GVCs). We find that enterprises funded by both GVCs and private venture capitalists (PVCs) obtain more investment than enterprises funded purely by PVCs, and much more than those funded purely by GVCs. Also, markets with more GVC funding have more VC funding per enterprise and more VC-funded enterprises, suggesting that GVC finance largely augments rather than displaces PVC finance. There is also a positive association between mixed GVC/PVC funding and successful exits, as measured by initial public offerings (IPOs) and acquisitions, attributable largely to the additional investment.</description><author>Brander, James A.; Du, Qianqian; Hellmann, Thomas</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Mar 2015 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Performance Terms in CEO Compensation Contracts</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>De Angelis, David; Grinstein, Yaniv

I propose a new factor-the global downside market factor-to explain high returns to carry trades. I show that carry trades have high downside market risk, i.e. they crash systematically in the worst states of the world when the global stock market plunges or when a disaster occurs. The downside market factor explains the returns to currency portfolios sorted by the forward discount better than other factors previously proposed in the literature. GMM estimates of the downside beta premium are similar in the currency and stock markets, statistically significant and close to their theoretical value. High returns to carry trades are fair compensation for their high downside market risk.</description><author>Dobrynskaya, Victoria</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Aug 2014 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Capital Structure under Heterogeneous Beliefs</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Jung, Hae Won; Subramanian, Ajay
We develop a structural model to quantitatively analyze the effects of asymmetric beliefs and agency conflicts on capital structure. Capital structure reflects the dynamic tradeoff between the positive incentive effects of managerial optimism and the negative effects of risk-sharing costs. Consistent with empirical evidence, long-term debt declines with optimism, whereas short-term borrowing increases. Permanent and transitory risk components have contrasting effects. Long-term debt increases with the intrinsic risk, but varies nonmonotonically with the transient risk. Short-term borrowing declines with the intrinsic risk, but increases with the transient risk. Overall, our findings show that asymmetric beliefs significantly influence firms' financial policies.</description><author>Jung, Hae Won; Subramanian, Ajay</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Aug 2014 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>The Real Effect of Foreign Banks</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Bruno, Valentina; Hauswald, Robert
Although foreign banks can act as catalysts for financial and economic development, their role remains controversial because they might displace local lending, thereby tightening firms' overall access to credit. We study the economic channels through which domestic lending by foreign banks affects real economic activity in a large cross-section of developing and advanced countries. We find that foreign lending alleviates financial constraints and increases real growth net of the competitive reaction of local lenders. In addition to providing stable access to credit, foreign banks also mitigate the consequence of informational and legal obstacles to lending, especially in developing credit markets.</description><author>Bruno, Valentina; Hauswald, Robert</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Aug 2014 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>The Performance of Separate Accounts and Collective Investment Trusts</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Elton, Edwin J.; Gruber, Martin J.; Blake, Christopher R.

If he commits to a period of exclusive negotiation with one VC, he increases the probability to obtain financing but deal terms deteriorate.

Among liberalization policies, credit and interest rate controls have the most significant negative effect on inequality.

Collusion is neutralized by introducing a misalignment between the interests of the issuer and those of the intermediary. To achieve this, the intermediary commits to hold some of the securities. The intermediary then underprices the remaining securities and extracts any investor surplus through a "participation fee."

Second, expected and surprise yield changes can have opposite contemporaneous effects on expected inflation. Third, the survey forecasts and inflation rate can both be in the state. These three features are inconsistent with the Markov assumption.

We find that term structure anomalies can largely be accounted for by peso problems, probably along with a small time-varying risk premium for the full sample. However, peso problem explanations cannot resolve term structure anomalies for the postcrisis sample.

Furthermore, we find a positive time series relationship between aggregate asset growth (AG) and return momentum, and the effect of aggregate AG is stronger than that of variables related to business cycles and investor sentiment.

Despite that, we show that banks' incentives to collect information actually increase in the presence of information sharing. The reason is that when hard, standardized information is shared, banks' incentives to invest in soft, nonverifiable information increase.

Managers carrying high abnormal cash compensate for the low return on cash by making superior stock selection decisions, whereas less capable managers find abnormal cash costly and remain more fully invested in equities. Managers of high abnormal cash funds also proficiently satisfy fund outflows and control fund transaction costs, whereas low abnormal cash funds lack flexibility to cover outflows and can suffer from costly fire sales.

This challenges the idea that control should always be attached to equity-like claims and is in line with contractual terms used in venture capital, corporate venturing, and partnerships between biotech start-ups and large corporations.

We estimate that similar to 1% of closing prices are manipulated, of which only a small fraction is detected and prosecuted. We find that stocks with high levels of information asymmetry and mid to low levels of liquidity are most likely to be manipulated. A significant proportion of manipulation occurs on month/quarter-end days. Manipulation on these days is more likely in stocks with high levels of institutional ownership. Government regulatory budget has a strong effect on both manipulation and detection.</description><author>Comerton-Forde, Carole; Putnins, Talis J.</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2014 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Your Former Employees Matter: Private Equity Firms and Their Financial Advisors*</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Siming, Linus

We investigate patterns of abnormal stock performance around insider trades on the Dutch market. Listed firms in the Netherlands have a long tradition of limiting shareholders' rights. Using a change in corporate governance regulations as a natural experiment, we show that governance rules have a causal effect on insider trading profits. Our results imply that insider transactions are more profitable at firms where shareholder rights are not restricted by antishareholder mechanisms. These findings are inconsistent with internal monitoring of insider trading. Rather, we explain this empirical pattern by imperfect substitution between insider trading profits and other private benefits of control.</description><author>Cziraki, Peter; De Goeij, Peter; Renneboog, Luc</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2014 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>The Impact of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act on Shareholders and Managers of Foreign Firms*</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Duarte, Jefferson; Kong, Katie; Siegel, Stephan; Young, Lance
Existing evidence suggests that the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) may be beneficial to US investors, but that foreign firms are perhaps less likely to list in the USA after SOX. This raises the question of whether foreign firms avoid listing in the USA after SOX because the Act imposes unnecessary costs upon firms. The objective of this article is to reconcile the US and international evidence by distinguishing between the effect of SOX on controlling shareholders and managers of foreign firms and the effect on minority investors of these firms. Our results suggest that insiders of foreign firms believe that the regulation makes the extraction of value from minority investors more difficult and costly for them. Outside investors in foreign firms, on the other hand, seem on average to believe that SOX is beneficial to them. The combination of these results reconciles the existing US and international evidence regarding SOX.</description><author>Duarte, Jefferson; Kong, Katie; Siegel, Stephan; Young, Lance</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2014 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Volatility Bounds, Size, and Real Activity Prediction*</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Nieto, Belen; Rubio, Gonzalo

I analyze the effect of monetary policy actions on the cross-section of equity returns. Based on earlier theoretical work for the monetary transmission mechanism one can argue that changes in monetary policy should produce differentiated effects on firms and stocks with different characteristics. By using different portfolio sorts the results show that the impact of monthly changes in the Federal funds rate is greater for the returns of more financially constrained stocks (e.g., small and value stocks) than on the returns of stocks with a more favorable financial position (e.g., large and growth stocks). By using a VAR methodology, the results indicate that the negative effect of Fed funds rate shocks on stock returns comes from a corresponding negative effect on future expected cash flows (cash-flow news), which is stronger than the impact on future equity risk premia (discount rate news). Thus, cash-flow news is the main return component affected by changes in the Fed funds rate. These results are reasonably robust to different VAR specifications. Moreover, the dispersion in return responses to monetary shocks across stocks is explained by a similar dispersion in the effects into cash-flow news, which outweighs the dispersion in discount rate news betas. These results represent new evidence on the effect of monetary policy on stock prices and on the monetary transmission mechanism.</description><author>Maio, Paulo</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2014 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Activist Arbitrage, Lifeboats, and Closed-End Funds*</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Lenkey, Stephen L.
We present a dynamic rational expectations model of closed-end fund discounts that incorporates feedback effects from activist arbitrage and lifeboats. Both activist arbitrage and lifeboats distort closed-end fund prices and lead to narrower discounts. Furthermore, both activist arbitrage and lifeboats effectuate an ex post wealth transfer from managers to investors but an ex ante wealth transfer from low-ability managers to high-ability managers. On average, investor wealth is unaffected by either activist arbitrage or lifeboats because their potential benefits are factored into higher fund prices. Although lifeboats can reduce takeover attempts, they do not increase expected managerial wealth.</description><author>Lenkey, Stephen L.</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2014 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Risk Premium, Variance Premium, and the Maturity Structure of Uncertainty*</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Feunou, Bruno; Fontaine, Jean-Sebastien; Taamouti, Abderrahim; Tedongap, Romeo
Structural or no-arbitrage asset-pricing models emphasize risk factors that cannot be observed directly.

Empirically, the variance term structure reveals two predictors of the bond premium, the equity premium, and the variance premium, jointly. Similarly, the term structures of skewness and kurtosis measures also reveal risk factors, but these are subsumed in the predictive content of the variance.

In 2001, government guarantees for savings banks in Germany were removed following a lawsuit. We use this natural experiment to examine the effect of government guarantees on bank risk-taking. The results suggest that banks whose government guarantee was removed reduced credit risk by cutting off the riskiest borrowers from credit. Using a difference-in-differences approach we show that none of these effects are present in a control group of German banks to whom the guarantee was not applicable. Furthermore, savings banks adjusted their liabilities away from risk-sensitive debt instruments after the removal of the guarantee, while we do not observe this for the control group. We also document that yield spreads of savings banks' bonds increased significantly right after the announcement of the decision to remove guarantees, while the yield spread of a sample of bonds issued by the control group remained unchanged. The evidence implies that public guarantees may be associated with substantial moral hazard effects.</description><author>Gropp, Reint; Gruendl, Christian; Guettler, Andre</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Apr 2014 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Do Firms Benefit from Concentrating their Borrowing?

Examining the properties of stock returns has long been a central topic in finance. Most quantitative analyses conducted by academic researchers and practitioners focus only on the return distribution. However, the return distribution itself hardly helps to determine whether the price of a winner stock picked by using the momentum strategy reaches the level where the risk incurred from the falling of prices is imminent. Therefore, we construct an implied price risk index to quantify the downside risk of a stock and use it to manage the tail risk of the momentum strategy. The empirical results demonstrate that our modified strategy can not only achieve significant improvement on the overall performance but also substantially reduce the drastic losses suffered from the 2008 global recession. We also establish the connection between the implied price risk index and the cross-sectional return differences based on the well-known three factors, the market beta, the firm size, and the book-to-market ratio.</description><author>Chuang, Hongwei; Ho, Hwai-Chung</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Apr 2014 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Don't Fight the Fed!</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Maio, Paulo

A simple market-timing strategy produces an annual Sharpe ratio of 0.55 and a certainty equivalent return (CER) gain of 3.37% per year, whereas a buy-hold strategy has a Sharpe ratio of 0.41. Rotation trading strategies for portfolios sorted on size, book-to-market, and momentum have a Sharpe ratio and CER gain as high as 0.73 and 9.60% per year, respectively. Dynamic strategies for other asset classes also produce economically significant gains.

We examine whether equity issuances initial public offerings (IPOs) and seasoned equity offerings (SEOs) are in part driven by investor sentiment by using equity mutual fund flows to proxy for the rational and/or irrational components of aggregate demand for equity. We find that more firms issue equity when flows are higher and repurchase equity when flows are lower. More firms file with the Securities Exchange Commission when predicted flows in the expected issuance month are greater. Price revisions are positively related to contemporaneous flows and unexpected flows. Initial returns are positively related to contemporaneous flows only for IPO issuances. These results are driven by retail, and not institutional, flows. Our evidence suggests that investor sentiment partially drives equity issuances.</description><author>Chiu, H.

Household portfolios include risky bonds, beyond stocks, and respond to permanent labor income shocks. This article brings these features into a life-cycle setting, and shows that optimal stock investment is constant or increasing in age before retirement for realistic parameter combinations. The driver of such inversion in the life-cycle profile is the resolution of uncertainty regarding social security pension, which increases the investor's risk appetite. This occurs if a small positive contemporaneous correlation between permanent labor income shocks and stock returns is matched by a realistically high degree of risk aversion. Absent this combination, the typical downward-sloping profile obtains.

Financial institutions may be vulnerable to predatory short selling. When the stock of a financial institution is shorted aggressively, leverage constraints imposed by short-term creditors can force the institution to liquidate long-term investments at fire sale prices. For financial institutions that are sufficiently close to their leverage constraints, predatory short-selling equilibria coexist with no-liquidation equilibria (the vulnerability region) or may even be the unique equilibrium outcome (the doomed region). Increased coordination among short sellers expands the doomed region, where liquidation is the unique equilibrium. Our model provides a potential justification for temporary restrictions on short selling of vulnerable institutions and can be used to assess recent empirical evidence on short-sale bans.</description><author>Brunnermeier, Markus K.; Oehmke, Martin</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Oct 2014 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Decomposing Euro-Area Sovereign Spreads: Credit and Liquidity Risks</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Monfort, Alain; Renne, Jean-Paul

The recent financial crisis caused a shock to private wealth. Households with low financial literacy are less likely to own risky assets directly. Therefore, fewer of them report financial losses. More importantly, financially illiterate households are more prone to sell assets that have lost in value. Thereby losses become permanent, and these households do not participate in markets' resurgence. This flight from risky assets is persistent-the financial crisis may prove to be a traumatic experience that shapes investment behavior and gives rise to serious distributional consequences, as households with lower financial literacy face lower returns in the long run.</description><author>Bucher-Koenen, Tabea; Ziegelmeyer, Michael</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Oct 2014 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Collective Action Clauses for the Eurozone</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Bradley, Michael; Gulati, Mitu

Signed small trade turnover (SSTT) measures temporary uninformed buy or sell pressure that is initiated by small trades in the same direction. Using Nasdaq OMX Helsinki tick-by-tick trade data with known investor category, we confirm that SSTT is a robust proxy for uninformed trading. In the short term (1-3 months), stocks with a high proportion of signed small trades outperform, but in the medium (4-6 months) and long term (7-36 months), SSTT by individual investors has a negative correlation to stock returns, while SSTT by institutional investors and foreign nominees is not related to stock returns. Systematic trading behavior appears to better explain the excess return generated by the low SSTT portfolio relative to the high SSTT portfolio when compared to traditional risk factors in the CAPM and Fama-French models. In the aggregate, small trades are noise in the spirit of Kyle (1985) and Black (1986), but small trade behavior impacts the performance of individuals and not the performance of institutions. Large trades by both individuals and institutions perform better in the intermediate and long term, which lends some credibility to the practice of classifying larger trades as informed, but our results show that these trades are not always by institutions.</description><author>Leung, Henry; Rose, Annica; Westerholm, P.

In this article we establish cautiousness as a new downside risk aversion measure, using a portfolio problem with a risk-free bond, a stock, and an option. We show that, an investor has higher cautiousness (i) if and only if she is always more likely to buy the option; and (ii) if and only if she always demands more options per share. As an option's payoff is a convex function, increasing positions in the option increases the convexity of a portfolio, which leads to an increase in skewness. Thus the results in this article establish the link between cautiousness and skewness preference.</description><author>Huang, James; Stapleton, Richard</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Oct 2014 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Modeling Market Downside Volatility</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Feunou, Bruno; Jahan-Parvar, Mohammad R.; Tedongap, Romeo
We propose a new methodology for modeling and estimating time-varying downside risk and upside uncertainty in equity returns and for assessment of risk-return trade-off in financial markets. Using the salient features of the binormal distribution, we explicitly relate downside risk and upside uncertainty to conditional heteroskedasticity and asymmetry through binormal GARCH (BiN-GARCH) model. Based on S&amp;P 500 and international index returns, we find strong empirical support for existence of significant relative downside risk, and robust positive relationship between relative downside risk and conditional mode.</description><author>Feunou, Bruno; Jahan-Parvar, Mohammad R.; Tedongap, Romeo</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2013 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Dynamic Interactions Between Interest-Rate and Credit Risk: Theory and Evidence on the Credit Default Swap Term Structure</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Chen, Ren-Raw; Cheng, Xiaolin; Wu, Liuren
This paper examines the interaction between default risk and interest-rate risk in determining the term structure of credit default swap spreads at different industry sectors and credit-rating classes. The paper starts with a parsimonious three-factor interest-rate dynamic term structure and projects the credit spread at each industry sector and rating class to these interest-rate factors while also allowing the projection residual dynamics to depend on the level of the interest-rate factors. Estimation shows that credit risk exhibits intricate dynamic interactions with the interest-rate factors.</description><author>Chen, Ren-Raw; Cheng, Xiaolin; Wu, Liuren</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2013 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>How the 52-Week High and Low Affect Option-Implied Volatilities and Stock Return Moments</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Driessen, Joost; Lin, Tse-Chun; Van Hemert, Otto
We provide a new perspective on option and stock price behavior around 52-week highs and lows. We analyze whether option-implied volatilities (IVs) change when stock prices approach or break through their 52-week high or low. We also study the effects of highs and lows on a stock's beta and return volatility. We find that IVs and stock betas decrease when approaching a high or low, and that volatilities increase after breakthroughs. The effects are economically large and significant. The approach results can be explained by the anchoring theory. The breakthrough results are consistent with anchoring and the investor attention hypothesis.</description><author>Driessen, Joost; Lin, Tse-Chun; Van Hemert, Otto</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2013 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>A Theory of Net Debt and Transferable Human Capital</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Lambrecht, Bart M.; Pawlina, Grzegorz
Traditional theories of capital structure do not explain the puzzling phenomena of zero-leverage firms and negative net debt ratios. We develop a theory where firms adopt a net debt target that acts as a balancing variable between equityholders and managers. Negative (positive) net debt occurs in human (physical) capital intensive industries. Negative net debt arises because tradeable claims cannot be issued against transferable human capital. Heterogeneity in capital structure occurs when firms have debt that is not fully collateralized. Physical capital intensive firms take on high leverage but may underlever to avoid bankruptcy costs. This creates excess rents for managers (even if the supply of human capital is competitive) because wealth constraints prevent managers from coinvesting.</description><author>Lambrecht, Bart M.; Pawlina, Grzegorz</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2013 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Payout Policy Choices and Shareholder Investment Horizons</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Gaspar, Jose-Miguel; Massa, Massimo; Matos, Pedro; Patgiri, Rajdeep; Rehman, Zahid
This paper examines how shareholder investment horizons influence payout policy choices. The authors infer institutional shareholders' investment horizons using the churn rate of their overall stock portfolios prior to the payout decision. The authors find that the frequency and amount of repurchases increases with ownership by short-term investors to the detriment of dividends. They also find that the market reacts less positively to repurchase announcements made by firms held by short-term institutions. These findings are consistent with a model in which undervalued firms signal their value through repurchases, but firms held by short-term investors make repurchases more often because those investors care mostly about the short-term price reaction. Hence, the market rationally discounts the signal provided by such repurchases. Our findings suggest that shorter shareholder investment horizons might be one contributing factor to the increasing popularity of buybacks.</description><author>Gaspar, Jose-Miguel; Massa, Massimo; Matos, Pedro; Patgiri, Rajdeep; Rehman, Zahid</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2013 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>The Effect of Financing Constraints on Risk</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Lin, Huidan; Paravisini, Daniel

A credit shortage induces a permanent increase in the volatility and skewness of operating cash flows and an increase in the correlation between firm stock and market returns.

This article empirically relates the internal organization of a firm with decision making quality and corporate performance. We call "independent from the CEO" a top executive who joined the firm before the current CEO was appointed. In a very robust way, firms with a smaller fraction of independent executives exhibit (1) a lower level of profitability and (2) lower shareholder returns following large acquisitions. These results are unaffected when we control for traditional governance measures such as board independence or other well-studied shareholder friendly provisions. One interpretation is that "independently minded" top ranking executives act as a counter-power imposing strong discipline on their CEO, even though they are formally under his authority.</description><author>Landier, Augustin; Sauvagnat, Julien; Sraer, David; Thesmar, David</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2013 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Precautionary Hoarding of Liquidity and Interbank Markets: Evidence from the Subprime Crisis</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Acharya, Viral V.; Merrouche, Ouarda
We study the liquidity demand of large settlement banks in the UK and its effect on the money markets before and during the subprime crisis of 2007-08. We find that the liquidity demand of large settlement banks experienced a 30% increase in the period immediately following August 9 2007, the day when money markets froze, igniting the crisis. Following this shift, liquidity demand had a precautionary nature in that it rose on days of high payment activity and for banks with greater credit risk. This caused overnight interbank rates to rise, an effect virtually absent in the precrisis period.</description><author>Acharya, Viral V.; Merrouche, Ouarda</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2013 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>The Fundamentals of Commodity Futures Returns</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Gorton, Gary B.; Hayashi, Fumio; Rouwenhorst, K.

Commodity futures risk premiums vary across commodities and over time depending on the level of physical inventories. The convenience yield is a decreasing, nonlinear function of inventories. Price measures, such as the futures basis, prior futures returns, prior spot returns, and spot price volatilities reflect the state of inventories and are informative about commodity futures risk premiums. We verify these theoretical predictions using a comprehensive data set on 31 commodity futures and physical inventories between 1971 and 2010. We find no evidence that the positions of participants in futures markets predict risk premiums on commodity futures.</description><author>Gorton, Gary B.; Hayashi, Fumio; Rouwenhorst, K.

We study the predictability of stock returns using a pure macroeconomic measure of the world business cycle, namely the world's capital to output ratio. This variable tracks variation in expected stock returns in a group of the major industrial economies in the presence of world financial market-based predictor variables. The world's capital to output ratio exhibits strong out-of-sample predictive power in almost all countries studied. This is in contrast to financial market-based variables that almost never have out-of-sample forecasting power. Using the stock return predictability that we uncover, we find that international versions of conditional asset pricing models perform well. The world capital to output ratio also predicts bond returns, interest rate changes, and credit spreads. The results highlight the importance of world business conditions for financial markets.</description><author>Cooper, Ilan; Priestley, Richard</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jul 2013 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Three Solutions to the Pricing Kernel Puzzle</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Hens, Thorsten; Reichlin, Christian
The pricing kernel is an important link between economics and finance. In standard models of financial economics, it is proportional to the aggregate marginal utility in the economy. We first show that none of the three standard assumptions (completeness, risk aversion, and correct beliefs) is needed for the pricing kernel to be generally decreasing. If at least one of the three assumptions is violated, the pricing kernel can have increasing parts. We explain the economic principles that lead to an increasing part in the pricing kernel and compare the resulting pricing kernels with the empirical pricing kernel estimated in Jackwerth (2000, Rev.

Managers have the choice to take the firm private themselves in a management buyout or to seek private equity backing. We argue that managers seek private equity backing in case they are more constrained to finance the deal themselves. We confirm the hypothesis using a sample of UK public-to-private transactions over the period 1997-2003. A post going private performance analysis reveals that both management buyouts and private equity backed deals outperform their industry peers. However, private equity backed deals outperform their peers already before the deal takes place whereas management buyouts improve performance afterwards. This suggests a passive role for private equity firms in going private transactions.</description><author>Fidrmuc, Jana P.; Palandri, Alessandro; Roosenboom, Peter; van Dijk, Dick</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jul 2013 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Gender and Banking: Are Women Better Loan Officers?*</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Beck, Thorsten; Behr, Patrick; Guettler, Andre
Using a unique data set for a commercial bank in Albania, we analyze gender differences in loan officers' performance. Loans screened and monitored by female loan officers have a lower likelihood to turn problematic than loans handled by male loan officers. This effect cannot be explained by borrower or loan officer selection or differences in screening, work load, and experience. However, while the performance gap always exists for female borrowers, female loan officers only gain a performance advantage with male borrowers with experience and do not have an advantage with borrowers that are legal entities. We therefore interpret this as suggestive evidence for female loan officers' better capacity to build trust relationships with borrowers.</description><author>Beck, Thorsten; Behr, Patrick; Guettler, Andre</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jul 2013 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Who takes Risks When and Why: Determinants of Changes in Investor Risk Taking</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Weber, Martin; Weber, Elke U.; Nosic, Alen
Between September 08 and June 09, a period with significant market events, we surveyed UK online-brokerage customers at 3-month intervals for their willingness to take risk, 3-month expectations of returns and risks for the market and their own portfolio, and self-reported risk attitude. This unique dataset allowed us to analyze how these variables changed over time, and whether changes in risk taking were related to changes in expectations and/or risk attitudes. Risk taking changed substantially during the period, as did return and risk expectations. Numeric assessments of return and risk expectations were only weakly correlated with corresponding subjective judgments. Consistent with the risk-as-feelings hypothesis, changes in risk taking were associated with changes in subjective expectations of market portfolio risk and returns, but less with changes in numeric expectations.</description><author>Weber, Martin; Weber, Elke U.; Nosic, Alen</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jul 2013 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Portfolio Pumping, Trading Activity and Fund Performance</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Bhattacharyya, Sugato; Nanda, Vikram

Around stock splits, retail trading correlations (RTCs) decrease with stocks in the presplit price range and increase with stocks in the post-split price range. These shifts in RTCs induce changes in return comovements. In the cross section, return comovements among low-priced stocks are amplified when retail trades are more correlated and when aggregate uncertainty amplifies behavioral biases. We find similar patterns among local stocks and when firms change their corporate headquarters. In contrast to retail trading, institutional trading attenuates return comovements.</description><author>Kumar, Alok; Page, Jeremy K.; Spalt, Oliver G.</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jul 2013 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Portfolio Choice and Mental Health</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Bogan, Vicki L.; Fertig, Angela R.

Based on a textual analysis of initial public offering (IPO) prospectuses, we obtain a number of important findings regarding the relation between the conservatism in prospectuses, IPO pricing, and subsequent operating and stock return performance. First, prospectus conservatism is positively related to underpricing, with the relation more pronounced for technology than nontechnology firms. Second, for nontechnology IPOs, prospectus conservatism is able to predict the firm's post-IPO operating performance. Specifically, we find that conservatism is inversely related to the firm's operating performance for the 3 years following the IPO. However, this predictability is limited to nontechnology IPOs. Finally, we find some evidence that for nontechnology IPOs conservatism is inversely related to the firm's post-IPO abnormal stock return. We conclude that the conservatism contained in an IPO's prospectus contains useful information about pricing and subsequent operating and stock return performance. Moreover, prospectus conservatism for nontechnology IPOs deserves more attention from investors.</description><author>Ferris, Stephen P.; Hao; Liao</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jul 2013 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Hedge Funds and Equity Prices</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Jiao, Yawen

In this expansion period, their trading predicts increasing one-quarter-ahead stock returns and return reversals in the 2nd year. These reversals stem from the expansion of mature funds, while young funds' trading predicts one-quarter-ahead returns without future reversals. The above price pressures disappear when hedge funds shift to contractions in the financial crisis. These findings are consistent with mature funds' expansions exerting pressures on equities and young funds possessing stock picking skills.</description><author>Jiao, Yawen</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jul 2013 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Market Selection and Welfare in a Multi-asset Economy</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Fedyk, Yurii; Heyerdahl-Larsen, Christian; Walden, Johan

Our results contrast with previous studies of single-asset economies, which find modest underperformance by irrational investors.

Adjusted for this effect, elevated momentum profits resulting from characteristics (size, R-2, turnover, age, analyst coverage, analyst forecast dispersion, market-to-book, price, illiquidity, credit rating) disappear almost entirely.

Optimism (respectively overconfidence) as well as pessimism (respectively doubt) emerge from the learning process. Furthermore, we obtain a positive correlation between pessimism (respectively doubt) and risk tolerance. Under reasonable assumptions, beliefs exhibit a pessimistic bias and, as a consequence, the risk premium is higher than in a standard setting.</description><author>Jouini, Elyes; Napp, Clotilde; Viossat, Yannick</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Apr 2013 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Institutional Investors as Minority Shareholders</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Hamdani, Assaf; Yafeh, Yishay

Potentially conflicted institutions are more likely to vote for insiders' proposals than stand-alone investors, regardless of their effect on outcomes.

Remuneration systems in the banking industry, in particular bonus payments, have frequently been blamed for contributing to the buildup of risks leading to the recent financial crisis.

Competition for talent sets incentives to offer bonuses inducing risk-taking that is excessive not only from society's perspective but also from the viewpoint of the banks themselves.

Optimal performance evaluation combines absolute and relative components in order to make runs less likely. When runs induce large price discounts, this requires a high degree of absolute performance evaluation and a low degree of relative performance evaluation. The overall costs of using performance evaluation are shown to be decreasing in asset liquidity, implying that more developed financial markets should have more delegation.

These will be higher the higher the inflation, and the more levered the firm. The behavior of abnormal returns of US stocks on dividend-announcement days from 1955 to 2007 supports these predictions.

UK firms responded to negative say on pay voting outcomes by removing controversial CEO pay practices criticized as rewards for failure (e.g., generous severance contracts) and increasing the sensitivity of pay to poor realizations of performance.</description><author>Ferri, Fabrizio; Maber, David A.</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Apr 2013 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>The Determinants of Mutual Fund Performance: A Cross-Country Study</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Ferreira, Miguel A.; Keswani, Aneel; Miguel, Antonio F.; Ramos, Sofia B.
We use a new data set to study the determinants of the performance of open-end actively managed equity mutual funds in 27 countries. We find that mutual funds underperform the market overall. The results show important differences in the determinants of fund performance in the USA and elsewhere in the world. The US evidence of diminishing returns to scale is not a universal truth as the performance of funds located outside the USA and funds that invest overseas is not negatively affected by scale. Our findings suggest that the adverse scale effects in the USA are related to liquidity constraints faced by funds that, by virtue of their style, have to invest in small and domestic stocks. Country characteristics also explain fund performance. Funds located in countries with liquid stock markets and strong legal institutions display better performance.</description><author>Ferreira, Miguel A.; Keswani, Aneel; Miguel, Antonio F.; Ramos, Sofia B.</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Apr 2013 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Payment Defaults and Interfirm Liquidity Provision</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Boissay, Frederic; Gropp, Reint
Using a unique data set on French firms, we show that credit constrained firms that face liquidity shocks are more likely to default on their payments to suppliers. Credit constrained firms pass on a sizeable fraction of such shocks to their suppliers. This is consistent with the idea that firms provide liquidity insurance to each other and that this mechanism is able to alleviate credit constraints. We show that the chain of defaults stops when it reaches unconstrained firms. Liquidity appears to be allocated from firms with access to outside finance to credit constrained firms along supply chains.</description><author>Boissay, Frederic; Gropp, Reint</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Nov 2013 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Product Market Linkages, Manager Quality, and Mutual Fund Performance</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Huang, Lixin; Kale, Jayant R.
Mutual funds typically invest a disproportionately large portion of their portfolio in one industry (main industry). We present a simple theoretical model to demonstrate that better mutual fund managers make larger investments in the important supplier/customer industries related to the main industry. Consistent with our theory, empirical tests on a large sample of mutual funds show that investment in related industries is positively associated with fund performance and plays a more significant role in explaining fund performance than investment in the main industry. Furthermore, the positive relation between main investment and fund performance obtains only when related investment is high.</description><author>Huang, Lixin; Kale, Jayant R.</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Nov 2013 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Irrationality or Efficiency of Macroeconomic Survey Forecasts?

Recent findings indicate that macroeconomic survey forecasts are anchoring biased and therefore are inefficient. However, despite highly significant test coefficients, a bias adjustment does not improve forecasts' quality. We find that the cognitive bias is a statistical artifact because the anchoring test is biased itself. In particular, it produces misleading results if macroeconomic analysts use more comprehensive information than assumed by the test. Our results have important implications for a wide range of empirical research relying on survey data to capture market participants' expectations, for example, studies analyzing the impact of macroeconomic conditions on asset prices, equity risk premiums, or market liquidity.</description><author>Hess, Dieter; Orbe, Sebastian</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Nov 2013 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>The Risk Sensitivity of Capital Requirements: Evidence from an International Sample of Large Banks</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Vallascas, Francesco; Hagendorff, Jens
Using an international sample of large banks between 2000 and 2010, we evaluate the risk sensitivity of minimum capital requirements. Our results show that risk-weighted assets (the regulatory measure of portfolio risk, which determines minimum capital requirements) are ill-calibrated to a market measure of bank portfolio risk. We show that this low-risk sensitivity of capital requirements permits banks to build up capital buffers by underreporting their portfolio risk and undermines banks' ability to withstand adverse shocks. While the risk sensitivity of capital requirements is higher for banks that have adopted Basel II, it remains low across banks and countries.</description><author>Vallascas, Francesco; Hagendorff, Jens</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Nov 2013 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Governance and Equity Prices: Does Transparency Matter?</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Gu, Lifeng; Hackbarth, Dirk
This article examines how accounting transparency and corporate governance interact.

The effect is largely monotonic-it is small and insignificant for opaque firms and large and significant for transparent firms-and survives numerous robustness tests. We find supportive evidence for firm value and operating performance. Hence, governance and transparency are complements. This complementarity effect is consistent with the view that more transparent firms are more likely takeover targets, because acquirers can bid more effectively and identify synergies more precisely.</description><author>Gu, Lifeng; Hackbarth, Dirk</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Nov 2013 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Risk in Islamic Banking</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Abedifar, Pejman; Molyneux, Philip; Tarazi, Amine

Small retail investors drive this result. Retail ownership breadth increases appear to be correlated with overpricing.

We also show when it has the opposite effect. We further analyze when mandatory deferred compensation can complement a policy that requires financial institutions to retain a minimum exposure to their originated loans, and we discuss the impact of a tax on short-term bonus pay.

In capital-intensive industries, firms face complicated multi-staged financing, investment, and production decisions under the watchful eye of existing and potential industry rivals. In various representations of this environment, we show that a first-mover advantage in debt weakly dominates a first-mover advantage in capacity. Without a first-mover advantage in debt, the incumbent may suffer a dead-weight loss. When both the entrant and incumbent deploy debt prior to capacity, a first-mover in capacity benefits from softer competition. With a long-purse debt cost, leading in debt still remains advantageous.</description><author>Leach, J.

We analyze the impact of bank internationalization on domestic market power (Lerner index) and risk for German banks. Risk is measured by the official declaration of regulatory authorities that a bank is distressed. We distinguish the volume of foreign assets, the number of foreign countries, and different modes of foreign entry. Our analysis has three main results. First, higher market power is associated with lower risk. Second, holding assets in many countries reduce market power at home, but banks with a higher share of foreign assets exhibit higher market power. Third, bank internationalization is only weakly related to bank risk.</description><author>Buch, Claudia M.; Koch, Catherine T.; Koetter, Michael</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jul 2013 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Corporate Investments and Learning*</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Moyen, Nathalie; Platikanov, Stefan
Using age as a proxy for learning within a firm, we show that the investments of firms with younger projects react more to profit realizations. With time, firms learn about their long-term quality, and their investment decisions become less influenced by the random shocks they receive. We also show that the learning process depends on the volatility of the economic environment. In more volatile industries, firms observe more noise and less signal from profit realizations. Their investments are therefore less influenced by profits. These new empirical results are consistent with a Tobin's q framework augmented with Bayesian learning.</description><author>Moyen, Nathalie; Platikanov, Stefan</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jul 2013 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>The "Fed Model" and the Predictability of Stock Returns*</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Maio, Paulo
The focus of this article is on the predictive role of the stock-bond yield gap-the difference between the stock market earnings (dividend) yield and the 10-year Treasury bond yield-also known as the "Fed model". The results show that the yield gap forecasts positive excess market returns, both at short and long forecasting horizons, and for both value- and equal-weighted stock indexes, and it also outperforms competing predictors commonly used in the literature. These findings go in line with the predictions from a present-value decomposition. The absence of predictive power for dividend growth, dividend payout ratios, earnings growth, and future one-period interest rates, actually strengthens the return predictability associated with the yield gap at very long horizons. By performing an out-of-sample analysis, the results show that the yield gap has reasonable out-of-sample predictability for the equity premium when the comparison is made against a simple historical average, especially when one imposes a restriction of positive equity premia. Furthermore, the yield gap proxies generally show greater out-of-sample forecasting power than the alternative state variables. An investment strategy based on the forecasting ability of the yield gap produces significant gains in Sharpe ratios.</description><author>Maio, Paulo</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jul 2013 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Hedging Surprises, Jumps, and Model Misspecification: A Risk Management Perspective on Hedging S&amp;P 500 Options*</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Kaeck, Andreas

Do public equity markets serve an unique role that is not easily served by other forms of financing in emerging economies? We analyze this question using the collapse of India's equity market in 1997, which provides an exogenous shock to firms' ability to issue equity. We find that both public and private firms exhibit higher bankruptcy rates and lower growth after 1997. The decline in growth is greater among firms with more external finance needs and fewer tangible assets. Overall, the evidence suggests that public equity markets are an important, not easily replaced, source of finance in emerging economies.</description><author>Gopalan, Radhakrishnan; Gormley, Todd A.</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Sep 2013 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Trading and Under-Diversification</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Anderson, Anders

Why do firms pay dividends? To answer this question, we use a hand-collected data set of companies traded on the London stock market between 1825 and 1870. As tax rates were effectively zero, the capital market was unregulated, and there were no institutional stockholders, we can rule out these potential determinants ex ante. We find that, even though they were legal, share repurchases were not used by firms to return cash to shareholders. Instead, our evidence provides support for the information-communication explanation for dividends, while providing little support for agency, illiquidity, catering, or behavioral explanations.</description><author>Turner, John D.; Ye, Qing; Zhan, Wenwen</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Sep 2013 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Venture Capital and Corporate Governance in the Newly Public Firm</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Hochberg, Yael V.

The authors study the impact of a powerful nonfinancial stakeholder-unionized workers-on the pricing of corporate debt. Firms in more unionized industries have lower bond yields. This relation is stronger in firms with weaker financial conditions and cannot be explained by the correlation of unionization with industry characteristics, governance mechanisms, or financial leverage. Firms in unionized industries implement less risky investment policies and are less likely targets of acquisitions. Unionization reduces yields by more when firms' takeover barriers are lower. Hence, unions are viewed favorably in the bond market because, through their influence on corporate affairs, they protect bondholders' wealth.</description><author>Chen, Huafeng; Kacperczyk, Marcin; Ortiz-Molina, Hernan</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Apr 2012 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Option-Implied Measures of Equity Risk</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Chang, Bo-Young; Christoffersen, Peter; Jacobs, Kris; Vainberg, Gregory
Equity risk measured by beta is of great interest to both academics and practitioners. Existing estimates of beta use historical returns. Many studies have found option-implied volatility to be a strong predictor of future realized volatility. We find that option-implied volatility and skewness are also good predictors of future realized beta. Motivated by this finding, we establish a set of assumptions needed to construct a beta estimate from option-implied return moments using equity and index options. This beta can be computed using only option data on a single day. It is therefore potentially able to reflect sudden changes in the structure of the underlying company.</description><author>Chang, Bo-Young; Christoffersen, Peter; Jacobs, Kris; Vainberg, Gregory</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Apr 2012 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Tying in Universal Banks</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Loranth, Gyoengyi; Morrison, Alan D.

When investment banking is uncompetitive, the former effect dominates, and there is too little tying; when investment banking is competitive, there is too much tying.

We examine firms' strategic incentives to engage in horizontal mergers. In a real options framework, we show that strategic considerations may explain abnormally high takeover activity during periods of positive and negative demand shocks. Importantly, this pattern emerges solely as a result of firms' strategic interaction in output markets. We show that the U-shaped relation between the state of demand and the propensity of firms to merge, documented in past studies, is driven by horizontal mergers in industries that are: (1) relatively more concentrated, (2) characterized by relatively strong competitive interaction among firms, and (3) characterized by relatively low merger-related operating synergies and restructuring costs. The empirical evidence, based on parametric and semi-parametric regression analyses, is consistent with these predictions.</description><author>Bernile, Gennaro; Lyandres, Evgeny; Zhdanov, Alexei</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Apr 2012 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>The Dynamics of Going Public</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Bustamante, M.

When adverse selection is more relevant (cold markets), firms with better investment prospects accelerate their IPO relative to their perfect information benchmark to reveal their type to outside investors. When adverse selection is less relevant (hot markets), all firms issue simultaneously, issuers are younger on average, and IPO timing is uninformative. An extension with multiple signals and the empirical evidence show that better ranked firms are younger, issue a lower fraction of shares, and underprice more during cold markets, and that issuers are younger on average during hot markets.</description><author>Bustamante, M.

This paper examines the relation between information differences across investors (i.e., information asymmetry) and the cost of capital and establishes that with perfect competition information asymmetry makes no difference. Instead, a firm's cost of capital is governed solely by the average precision of investors' information. With imperfect competition, however, information asymmetry affects the cost of capital even after controlling for investors' average precision. In other words, the capital market's degree of competition plays a critical role for the relation between information asymmetry and the cost of capital.

This article examines competition and investor behavior in the mutual fund industry for the universe of US mutual funds during 1976-2009. Over this period, industry assets increased by a factor of 200, the number of active fund families quadrupled, and the average market share of a family declined by four-fifths. We find that price competition and product differentiation are both effective strategies in obtaining market share. Families that pass along economies of scale to investors and those that charge lower fees than the competition gain market share, but only if these fees are above average to begin with. Loads and 12b-1 fees, however, have a positive effect on market share, consistent with the use of these types of fees for marketing and distribution. Families that perform better, offer a wider range of products, and start more funds relative to the competition (a measure of innovation) also have a higher market share. Innovation is rewarded more if the new fund is more differentiated from existing offerings. Overall, our evidence suggests that mutual fund families compete effectively along both price and non-price dimensions.</description><author>Khorana, Ajay; Servaes, Henri</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jan 2012 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Explaining Corporate Capital Structure: Product Markets, Leases, and Asset Similarity</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Rauh, Joshua D.; Sufi, Amir
Better measurement of the output produced and capital employed by firms substantially improves the ability to explain capital structure variation in the cross section. For every firm, we construct the set of other films producing the same output using the set of product market competitors listed in the firm's public Securities and Exchange Commission filings. In addition, we improve measurement of capital structure by explicitly accounting for leased capital. These two steps increase the explanatory power of the average capital structure of other firms producing similar output on a firm's capital structure by 50% compared to using only the average unadjusted debt ratio of other firms in the same three-digit Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) code. We provide evidence that the large explanatory power of the capital structure of other firms producing similar output is related to the assets used in the production process. Our findings suggest that what a firm produces and the assets used in production are the most important determinants of capital structure in the cross section.</description><author>Rauh, Joshua D.; Sufi, Amir</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jan 2012 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>The Dynamics of Venture Capital Contracts</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Bienz, Carsten; Hirsch, Julia
Using a detailed German data set on venture capital contracts, the authors document that contracts between venture capitalists (VC) and their portfolio firms specify more complete conditions for future financing for firms that do have no suitable outside financing option and therefore lower ex post bargaining power. The authors' result is consistent with theories of holdup, where complete contracts protect the entrepreneur from expropriation by the financier. Moreover, there is evidence of learning by VCs. Other possible explanations for observed contracts, such as multitasking or coordination costs, instead have little explanation power.</description><author>Bienz, Carsten; Hirsch, Julia</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jan 2012 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>The Role of Venture Capital Syndication in Value Creation for Entrepreneurial Firms</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Tian, Xuan
This paper provides evidence that venture capital (VC) syndication creates value for entrepreneurial firms in two dimensions. First, VC syndication creates product market value for their portfolio firms. Specifically, VC syndicates invest significant amounts in younger firms, in earlier financing rounds, and in early stage firms. Further, VC syndicates nurture innovation of their portfolio firms and help them achieve better post-initial public offering operating performance. Second, VC syndication creates financial market value for their portfolio firms. Specifically, VC syndicate-backed firms are more likely to have a successful exit, enjoy a lower initial public offering (IPO) underpricing, and receive a higher IPO market valuation. The findings are robust to a variety of alternative syndication measures, subsamples, econometric models, and controlling for endogeneity in VC syndication.</description><author>Tian, Xuan</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jan 2012 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Financial Markets Equilibrium with Heterogeneous Agents</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Cvitanic, Jaksa; Jouini, Elyes; Malamud, Semyon; Napp, Clotilde
This paper presents an equilibrium model in a pure exchange economy when investors have three possible sources of heterogeneity. Investors may differ in their beliefs, in their level of risk aversion, and in their time preference rate. The authors study the impact of investors' heterogeneity on equilibrium properties and, in particular, on the consumption shares, the market price of risk, the risk-free rate, the bond prices at different maturities, the stock price and volatility as well as on the stock's cumulative returns, and optimal portfolio strategies. The authors relate the heterogeneous economy with the family of associated homogeneous economies with only one class of investors. Cross-sectional as well as long-run properties are analyzed.</description><author>Cvitanic, Jaksa; Jouini, Elyes; Malamud, Semyon; Napp, Clotilde</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jan 2012 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Volatility in Equilibrium: Asymmetries and Dynamic Dependencies</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Bollerslev, Tim; Sizova, Natalia; Tauchen, George
Stock market volatility clusters in time, appears fractionally integrated, carries a risk premium, and exhibits asymmetric leverage effects. At the same time, the volatility risk premium, defined by the difference between the risk-neutral and objective expectations of the volatility, features short memory. This paper develops the first internally consistent equilibrium-based explanation for all these empirical facts. Using newly available high-frequency intraday data for the S&amp;P 500 and the VIX volatility index, the authors show that the qualitative implications from the new theoretical continuous-time model match remarkably well with the distinct shapes and patterns in the sample autocorrelations and dynamic cross-correlations actually observed in the data.</description><author>Bollerslev, Tim; Sizova, Natalia; Tauchen, George</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jan 2012 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Who Disciplines Bank Managers?</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Schaeck, Klaus; Cihak, Martin; Maechler, Andrea; Stolz, Stephanie

We find executives are more likely to be dismissed in risky institutions. Examining the roles of shareholders, debtholders, and regulators as monitors, we obtain evidence for shareholder discipline. However, there is no evidence that risk affects dismissals more if debtholders have a larger stake in the bank or when regulators are aware of distress.

In a model with endogenous delegation, the authors find that delegation leads to a more informative price system and lower equity premia.

When contracts are unobserved (and nonexclusive), agents can promise the same asset to multiple counterparties and subsequently default. I show that a central mechanism can extract all relevant information about contracts that agents enter by inducing them to report one another. The mechanism sets position limits and reveals the names of agents who hit the limits according to (voluntary) reports from their counterparties. This holds even if sending reports is costly and even if agents can collude. In some cases, an agent's position limit must be nonbinding in equilibrium.

The authors investigate optimal capital requirements in a model in which banks decide on their investment in credit scoring systems. The main result is that regulators should encourage sophisticated banks to keep their asset portfolios safe, while assets with high systematic risk should be concentrated in smaller banks. The proposed regulatory differentiation follows the Basel Accord's distinction between internal ratings-based approach and standard approach. Sophisticated banks should increase their equity capital relative to other banks, leading to further size differentiation. The moral hazard problem of banks misrepresenting their loan portfolio risk is analyzed, with the result that it induces stricter capital requirements.</description><author>Feess, Eberhard; Hege, Ulrich</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Oct 2012 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Private Equity Fund Size, Investment Size, and Value Creation*</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Humphery-Jenner, Mark
This paper examines why large private equity (PE) funds earn lower returns. The article argues that large PE funds are suited to making large investments and small PE funds are suited to nurturing start-ups. Thus, the suboptimal investment in small companies is one driver of the size effect in PE. A theoretical model and empirical results from a sample of 1,222 funds in the USA support this prediction. The largest 25% of PE funds earn internal rates of return of 5.17% when they invest in the largest 25% of companies but only -2.98% when they invest in the smallest 25%. This suggests that investment size is a driver of the size effect in PE.</description><author>Humphery-Jenner, Mark</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jul 2012 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Understanding the Real Rate Conundrum: An Application of No-Arbitrage Models to the UK Real Yield Curve</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Joyce, Michael A.

During 2004 and 2005, long-horizon interest rates fell sharply in major international government bond markets (Greenspan's "conundrum"). This common fall mainly reflected lower long real rates. To investigate possible causes, the authors apply a no-arbitrage affine modeling framework to understanding the UK real term structure. The authors find that time-varying term premia are important in explaining movements in long real forward rates. And, although there is evidence that long-horizon expected short real rates declined over the conundrum period, the authors' results suggest that lower term premia played the dominant role. This could be consistent with the so-called "search for yield" and excess liquidity explanations for the conundrum.</description><author>Joyce, Michael A.

We find that before the introduction of the Euro, country effects dominate, while industry effects prevail after 1999. This reversal is driven mainly by the countries that were least integrated in the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) and world markets in the early 1990s and for which the EMU convergence process led to rapid strengthening of linkages with the core Euro-zone. For markets with stronger economic linkages, industry effects dominate both before and after the introduction of the Euro.</description><author>Eiling, Esther; Gerard, Bruno; De Roon, Frans A.</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jul 2012 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Is the Partial Adjustment Model a Useful Tool for Capital Structure Research?*</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Hovakimian, Armen; Li, Guangzhong

The authors use proprietary loan contracts and financial information negotiated between banks and private equity sponsors to explore the financial covenant structure and the determinants of covenant restrictiveness in a large set of leveraged buyouts. With respect to the covenant structure, we analyze the utilized types of financial covenants in sponsored loans and in comparable nonsponsored loans, such as highly levered term loans or loans used toward M&amp;A. The authors find that sponsored loans show less variation in the included types and combinations of covenants and include more financial covenants than the comparable nonsponsored loans. With respect to covenant restrictiveness, the authors measure precisely the distance between threshold and financial forecast. They show that two competing mechanisms, reduced information asymmetry costs and increased financial risk, affect the restrictiveness in sponsored loans.</description><author>Achleitner, Ann-Kristin; Braun, Reiner; Hinterramskogler, Bastian; Tappeiner, Florian</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jul 2012 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>An Examination of Mutual Fund Timing Ability Using Monthly Holdings Data</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Elton, Edwin J.; Gruber, Martin J.; Blake, Christopher R.

I derive and test implications of the operating leverage hypothesis for the cross-section of expected returns. Using a novel measure of operating leverage, I document that operating leverage predicts returns in the cross-section, and that strategies formed by sorting on operating leverage earn significant excess returns. Operating leverage also explains why the value premium is weak and non-monotonic across industries, but strong and monotonic within industries. Intra-industry differences in book-to-market are driven by differences in operating leverage, giving rise to expected return differences. Industry differences in book-to-market are driven by differences in the capital intensity of production unrelated to returns.</description><author>Novy-Marx, Robert</author><pubDate>Sat, 01 Jan 2011 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Approximate Equilibrium Asset Prices</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Restoy, Fernando; Weil, Philippe

This allows us to (approximately) price assets solely as a function of their payoffs and of consumption-in both homoskedastic or heteroskedastic environments.

A reallocation effect is at play, which we study in the context of mean-variance portfolio theory applied to sectoral returns. We find the reallocation is particularly strong in sectors characterized by young, small and external finance dependent firms, and for states that have a larger share of such sectors.

We develop an analytical solution to the dynamic portfolio choice problem of an investor with power utility defined over wealth at a finite horizon, who faces a time-varying investment opportunity set, parameterized using a flexible vector autoregression. We apply this framework to study the horizon effects in the allocations of equity-only investors, who hold a mix of value and growth indices, and a more general investor, who also has access to Treasury bills and bonds. We find that the mean allocation of equity-only investors is heavily tilted towards value stocks at short-horizons, but the magnitude of this tilt declines dramatically with the investment horizon, implying that growth is less risky than value at long horizons. Investors with access to bills and bonds exhibit similar behavior, when value and growth tilts are computed relative to the total equity allocation of the portfolio. However, after accounting for the propensity of these investors to increase their total equity allocation as the horizon increases, the mean value tilt of the optimal allocation is shown to be positive and stable across time.</description><author>Jurek, Jakub W.; Viceira, Luis M.</author><pubDate>Sat, 01 Jan 2011 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Inside Debt</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Edmans, Alex; Liu, Qi
Existing theories advocate the exclusive use of equity-like instruments in executive compensation. However, recent empirical studies document the prevalence of debt-like instruments such as pensions. This paper justifies the use of debt as efficient compensation. Inside debt is a superior solution to the agency costs of debt than the solvency-contingent bonuses and salaries proposed by prior literature, since its payoff depends not only on the incidence of bankruptcy but also firm value in bankruptcy. Contrary to intuition, granting the manager equal proportions of debt and equity is typically inefficient. In most cases, an equity bias is desired to induce effort. However, if effort is productive in increasing liquidation value, or if bankruptcy is likely, a debt bias can improve effort as well as alleviate the agency costs of debt. The model generates a number of empirical predictions consistent with recent evidence.</description><author>Edmans, Alex; Liu, Qi</author><pubDate>Sat, 01 Jan 2011 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Is College a Focal Point of Investor Life?</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Massa, Massimo; Simonov, Andrei

If an individual with expected utility and a reasonable level of wealth rejects a small actuarially favorable gamble, it implies a very high degree of risk aversion. It also predicts (counterfactually) the rejection of more sizable and very attractive bets. If additional background uncertainty affects wealth, this result also applies to non-expected utilities. The authors describe a set of reasonable conditions under which an individual may reject the small bet but accept the large bet, even in the presence of background uncertainty. The two critical assumptions that the authors use are rank-dependent utility and a discrete distribution for background risk. Plausible calibrations can reconcile large/small bet risk attitudes and the empirical evidence on limited stock market participation in the presence of labor income risk.</description><author>Chapman, David A.; Polkovnichenko, Valery</author><pubDate>Sat, 01 Oct 2011 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Optimal Portfolio Choice over the Life Cycle with Flexible Work, Endogenous Retirement, and Lifetime Payouts</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Chai, Jingjing; Horneff, Wolfram; Maurer, Raimond; Mitchell, Olivia S.

However, the assets we consider can only eliminate a relatively small fraction of the welfare costs of labor income risk over the life cycle.

This paper studies the life-cycle consumption and portfolio choice problem taking account of annuity risk at retirement. The study allows for government-provided annuity income. Optimally, households allocate retirement wealth to nominal, inflation-linked and variable annuities, and condition this choice on the state of the economy. The case in which there are limitations in the types of annuities that are available is also considered and the costs of annuity market incompleteness are quantified. Subsequently, the paper determines how investors optimally anticipate annuitization before retirement. The conclusion is that ignoring annuity risk before and at retirement can be economically costly.</description><author>Koijen, Ralph S. J.; Nijman, Theo E.; Werker, Bas J.

Using data from the European Social Survey, we estimate individual-level trust by applying a hierarchical item response model. Combining these estimates with data on Spanish households' financial decisions from the Survey of Household Finances, we show that households with less trust invest more in housing and less in financial assets, in particular risky ones. Trust thus may drive not only (limited) stock market participation but also financial development more generally.</description><author>El-Attar, Mayssun; Poschke, Markus</author><pubDate>Sat, 01 Oct 2011 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Trust, Sociability, and Stock Market Participation</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Georgarakos, Dimitris; Pasini, Giacomo
This article investigates the importance of both trust and sociability for stock market participation and for differences in stockholding across Europe. We estimate significant effects for the two, and find that sociability can partly balance the discouragement effect on stockholding induced by low regional prevailing trust. We test for exogeneity of trust and sociability indicators using variation in history of political institutions and in frequency of contacts with grandchildren, respectively. Moreover, the effect of trust is stronger in countries with limited participation and low average trust, offering an explanation for the remarkably low stockholding rates of the wealthy living therein.</description><author>Georgarakos, Dimitris; Pasini, Giacomo</author><pubDate>Sat, 01 Oct 2011 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Special issue on household finance Preface</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Haliassos, Michael; Jappelli, Tullio; Pagano, Marco; Zechner, Josef

This paper studies asymmetric profitability of the momentum trading strategy. When investors face Knightian uncertainty, they react differently to past winners and losers, which creates asymmetric patterns in price continuations. This asymmetry increases with the level of market and idiosyncratic uncertainty relating to the fundamental value of stocks. We provide a model explaining this phenomenon and empirical evidence supporting the hypothesis. Our results also imply that momentum is more likely to continue for downward trends in a highly uncertain market.</description><author>Kelsey, David; Kozhan, Roman; Pang, Wei</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jul 2011 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Informed Finance and Technological Conservatism</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Minetti, Raoul
This paper studies an economy in which firms can operate either a mature or a new technology and lenders acquire information on the productive assets of the borrowing firms that are eligible as collateral. We demonstrate that when contracts are imperfectly enforceable informed lenders offer inexpensive funding for the mature technology but may choose not to finance the new one, seeking to preserve the value of their information on the mature assets. Using firm-level data from Italy, we find that banks that establish long-term relationships with firms promote technological progress on average. However, we find that relationship banks inhibit innovations that entail a large depreciation of existing technology-specific information such as radical innovations.</description><author>Minetti, Raoul</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jul 2011 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Unbiased Disagreement in Financial Markets, Waves of Pessimism and the Risk-Return Trade-off</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Jouini, Elyes; Napp, Clotilde
Can investors with irrational beliefs be neglected as long as they are rational on average? Do their trades cancel out with no consequences on prices, as implicitly assumed by traditional models? We consider a model with irrational investors, who are rational on average. We obtain waves of pessimism and optimism that lead to countercyclical market prices of risk and procyclical risk-free rates. The variance of the state price density is greatly increased. The long run risk-return relation is modified; in particular, the long run market price of risk might be higher than both the instantaneous and the rational ones.</description><author>Jouini, Elyes; Napp, Clotilde</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jul 2011 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Returns to Private Equity - Idiosyncratic Risk Does Matter!</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Mueller, Elisabeth
Owners of private companies often invest a substantial share of their net worth in one company, which exposes them to idiosyncratic risk. We investigate whether owners of US companies require compensation for lack of diversification in the form of higher returns on equity. Exposure to idiosyncratic risk is measured as the share of the owner's net worth invested in the company. Equity returns are measured as the earnings rate and as capital gains. For both returns measures we find a positive and significant influence of exposure to idiosyncratic risk.

This paper investigates the role of banking supervision in controlling bank risk. Banking supervision is measured in terms of enforcement outputs (i.e., on-site audits and sanctions). Our results show an inverted U-shaped relationship between on-site audits and bank risk, while the relationship between sanctions and risk appears to be linear and negative. We also consider the combined effect of effective supervision and banking regulation (in the form of capital and market discipline requirements) on bank risk. We find that effective supervision and market discipline requirements are important and complementary mechanisms in reducing bank fragility. This is in contrast to capital requirements, which prove to be rather futile in controlling bank risk, even when supplemented with a higher volume of on-site audits and sanctions.</description><author>Delis, Manthos D.; Staikouras, Panagiotis K.</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jul 2011 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Is There a Relationship Benefit in Credit Ratings?</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Maehlmann, Thomas

This paper considers a stock market with ambiguity-averse informed investors under the CARA-normal setting, and studies the relationship between limited market participation and the equity premium which is decomposed into the risk premium and the ambiguity premium. In a rational expectations equilibrium, limited market participation arises if the largest deviation of investors' ambiguity increases sufficiently or if the variance of the stock return decreases sufficiently. In each case, a change in the risk premium and a change in the ambiguity premium may have opposite signs. This paper identifies conditions under which a change with the plus sign dominates and thus the equity premium increases when fewer investors participate in the stock market.</description><author>Ui, Takashi</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Apr 2011 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Shareholder-Manager Disagreement and Corporate Investment*</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Thakor, Anjan V.; Whited, Toni M.

This proxy is unrelated to traditional indicators of asymmetric information. We also find that variation in disagreement is an important component of the portion of the variation in Tobin's q that matters for investment, and that disagreement affects investment and Tobin's q more if the firm has greater financial flexibility.</description><author>Thakor, Anjan V.; Whited, Toni M.</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Apr 2011 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>IPO Information Aggregation and Underwriter Quality*</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Wang, Wei; Yung, Chris
A key distinction between some models of IPO pricing (e.g., auctions and bookbuilding) and others (e.g., fixed-priced models) is whether price discovery occurs in the primary or secondary market. Higher investment bank reputation is associated with 1) more active filing price revisions and 2) reduced secondary market volatility, indicating greater resolution of uncertainty before trading begins. Revisions of nonreputable banks cluster on exactly zero dollars. Finally, the "partial adjustment" phenomenon - often attributed to information aggregation - is primarily due to the behavior of reputable underwriters. We conclude that theoretical models of primary market information aggregation are better suited for reputable underwriters.</description><author>Wang, Wei; Yung, Chris</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Apr 2011 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Survivorship Bias and Mutual Fund Performance: Relevance, Significance, and Methodical Differences*</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Rohleder, Martin; Scholz, Hendrik; Wilkens, Marco

Our findings show that the former issue more valuable recommendations.

We investigate an IPO security design problem when information asymmetries across investors lead to a winner's curse. Firms that are riskier in down markets can lower the cost of going public by using unit IPOs, in which equity and warrants are combined into a non-divisible package. Furthermore, firms that have a sizeable growth potential even in bad states of the world can fully eliminate the winner's curse problem by making the warrants callable. Our theory is consistent with the prominent use of unit IPOs and produces empirical implications that differentiate it from existing theories.</description><author>Chakraborty, Archishman; Gervais, Simon; Yilmaz, Bilge</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Apr 2011 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Franchising Microfinance</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Bubna, Amit; Chowdhry, Bhagwan
Financial intermediaries worldwide are seeking mechanisms for participating in micro lending.

A coalition of local capitalists may not resolve the problem in the presence of a monopoly moneylender with superior skills in lending and enforcement. A credible competitive threat to the moneylender can only arise if the local capitalist coalition also provides information sharing benefits that lower their cost of lending vis-a-vis the moneylender. Franchising allows local capitalists to form such a coalition. We analyze conditions under which welfare-enhancing franchising would obtain.</description><author>Bubna, Amit; Chowdhry, Bhagwan</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jul 2010 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Safe Haven Currencies</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Ranaldo, Angelo; Soederlind, Paul

We document that the Swiss franc and Japanese yen appreciate against the US dollar when US stock prices decrease and US bond prices and FX volatility increase. These safe haven properties materialise over different time granularities (from a few hours to several days) and non-linearly with the volatility factor and during crises.

We study, both theoretically and in the lab, the performance of debt and equity auctions in the presence of both private information and hidden effort.

Most importantly they manage their clients' money, not their own. In this paper we test experimentally how individuals take risk with other people's ("clients") money.

Portfolio-level analyses and firm-level cross-sectional regressions indicate that the well-documented contrarian profits soar when value stocks which repurchase shares (value repurchasers) and growth stocks which issue shares (growth issuers) are considered. Various risk measures indicate that value repurchasers are not riskier than growth issuers. Furthermore, time-series of realized growth rates, analysts' long-term growth estimates, and sensitivity of portfolio returns to investor sentiment support the misvaluation explanation.</description><author>Bali, Turan G.; Demirtas, K.

The paper shows that mispriced deposit insurance and capital regulation were of second-order importance in determining the capital structure of large U.S. and European banks during 1991 to 2004. Instead, standard cross-sectional determinants of non-financial firms' leverage carry over to banks, except for banks whose capital ratio is close to the regulatory minimum. Consistent with a reduced role of deposit insurance, we document a shift in banks' liability structure away from deposits towards non-deposit liabilities. We find that unobserved time-invariant bank fixed-effects are ultimately the most important determinant of banks' capital structures and that banks' leverage converges to bank specific, time-invariant targets.</description><author>Gropp, Reint; Heider, Florian</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Oct 2010 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Out-of-Court Restructuring versus Formal Bankruptcy in a Non-Interventionist Bankruptcy Setting</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Jostarndt, Philipp; Sautner, Zacharias

We achieve this convergence by stating that the spread between domestic and euro short-term interest rate follows the Brownian bridge process.

We propose a model for stock price dynamics that explicitly incorporates random waiting times between trades, also known as duration, and show how option prices can be calculated using this model. We use ultra-high-frequency data for blue-chip companies to motivate a particular choice of waiting-time distribution and then calibrate risk-neutral parameters from options data. We also show that the convexity commonly observed in implied volatilities may be explained by the presence of duration between trades. Furthermore, we find that, ceteris paribus, implied volatility decreases in the presence of longer durations, a result consistent with the findings of Engle (2000) and Dufour and Engle (2000) which demonstrates the relationship between levels of activity and volatility for stock prices. Finally, by directly employing information given by time-stamps of trades, our approach provides a direct link between the literature on stochastic time changes and business time (see Clark (1973)) and, at the same time, highlights the link between number and time of arrival of transactions with implied volatility and stochastic volatility models.</description><author>Cartea, Alvaro; Meyer-Brandis, Thilo</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Oct 2010 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Do Firms Believe in Interest Rate Parity?</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>McBrady, Matthew R.; Mortal, Sandra; Schill, Michael J.
Using a broad sample of international corporate bond offerings, we provide evidence that corporate borrowers make opportunistic currency choices, in that they denominate the currency of their bonds in a manner that is inconsistent with a belief in either covered or uncovered interest rate parity. Using firm-level tests, we identify a number of characteristics of firms that engage in opportunistic behavior. We observe that large issuers located in developed markets with investment-grade ratings and low cash flow characterize those firms that are responsive to covered borrowing rate differences across currencies. Corporate responsiveness to uncovered borrowing rate differences appears more general. We observe that although the gains firms achieve through opportunistic currency denomination are economically significant, the yield differential tends to systematically decline after issuance. This finding suggests that opportunistic issuance by corporations may be a primary mechanism for driving covered interest yields toward parity.</description><author>McBrady, Matthew R.; Mortal, Sandra; Schill, Michael J.</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Oct 2010 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>The Limits of the Limits of Arbitrage</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Brav, Alon; Heaton, J.

In expansions, the bond market responds most strongly to bad news in non-farm payrolls, while in recessions good news about inflation is relatively more important.

When firms compete in the managerial labor market, the choice of corporate governance by a firm affects, and is affected by, the choice of governance by other firms. Firms with weaker governance offer managers more generous incentive compensation, which induces firms with good governance to also overpay their management. Due to this externality, overall level of governance in the economy can be inefficiently low. Poor governance can in fact be employed by incumbent firms to deter entry by new firms. Such corporate governance externalities have important implications for regulatory standards, ownership structure of firms, and the market for corporate control.</description><author>Acharya, Viral V.; Volpin, Paolo F.</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jan 2010 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Robust Portfolio Optimisation with Multiple Experts</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Lutgens, Frank; Schotman, Peter C.
We consider mean-variance portfolio choice of a robust investor. The investor receives advice from J experts, each with a different prior for expected returns and risk, and follows a min-max portfolio strategy. The robust investor endogenously combines the experts' estimates. When experts agree on the main return generating factors, the investor relies on the advice of the expert with the strongest prior. Dispersed advice leads to averaging of the alternative estimates. The robust investor is likely to outperform alternative strategies. The theoretical analysis is supported by numerical simulations for the 25 Fama-French portfolios and for 81 European country and value portfolios.</description><author>Lutgens, Frank; Schotman, Peter C.</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Apr 2010 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Market Anticipation of Fed Policy Changes and the Term Structure of Interest Rates</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Heidari, Massoud; Wu, Liuren
The Federal Reserve adjusts the federal funds target rate discretely, causing discontinuity in short-term interest rates. Unlike Poisson jumps, these adjustments are well anticipated by the market. We propose a term structure model that incorporates an anticipated jump component with known arrival times but random jump size. We find that doing so improves the model performance in capturing the term structure behavior. The mean jump sizes extracted from the term structure match the realized target rate changes well. Specification analysis indicates that the jump sizes show strong serial dependence and dependence on the interest-rate factors.</description><author>Heidari, Massoud; Wu, Liuren</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Apr 2010 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Decomposing European CDS Returns</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Berndt, Antje; Obreja, Iulian
Nearly half of the variation in European CDS returns is captured by a novel factor that mimics economic catastrophe risk. During the financial crisis of 2007-8, this factor became more important relative to other sources of risk, leading to a shift in the correlation structure of CDS returns. Using equivalent CDS and equity portfolios, we show that while crucial for explaining temporal and cross-sectional variation in CDS returns, the factor plays a lesser role for equity. This is likely due to the limited sensitivity of the equity value at default to whether the event is of systemic or idiosyncratic nature.</description><author>Berndt, Antje; Obreja, Iulian</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Apr 2010 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Determinants of Sovereign Risk: Macroeconomic Fundamentals and the Pricing of Sovereign Debt</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Hilscher, Jens; Nosbusch, Yves
This paper investigates the effects of macroeconomic fundamentals on emerging market sovereign credit spreads. We find that the volatility of terms of trade in particular has a statistically and economically significant effect on spreads. This is robust to instrumenting terms of trade with a country-specific commodity price index. Our measures of country fundamentals have substantial explanatory power, even controlling for global factors and credit ratings. We also estimate default probabilities in a hazard model and find that model implied spreads capture a significant part of the variation in observed spreads out-of-sample. The fit is better for lower credit quality borrowers.</description><author>Hilscher, Jens; Nosbusch, Yves</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Apr 2010 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Rating opaque borrowers: why are unsolicited ratings lower?</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Bannier, Christina E.; Behr, Patrick; Guettler, Andre
This paper examines why unsolicited ratings tend to be lower than solicited ratings. Both self-selection among issuers and strategic conservatism of rating agencies may be reasonable explanations. Analyses of default incidences of non-U.S. borrowers between January 1996 and December 2006 show that rating conservatism may play a role for industrial firms, but self-selection cannot be fully rejected. Neither can it for insurance companies, though data restrictions impede further conclusions. For unsolicited bank ratings, however, we find strong evidence that rating conservatism is an important cause. The downward bias also appears to increase along with banks' opaqueness.</description><author>Bannier, Christina E.; Behr, Patrick; Guettler, Andre</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Apr 2010 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Inflation Targeting and Exchange Rate Regimes: Evidence from the Financial Markets</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Brenner, Menachem; Sokoler, Meir
Inflation targeting is gaining popularity as a framework for conducting monetary policy.

This paper attempts to show that both policies are not sustainable. Israel is a classic test case. We test our hypothesis using information from the financial markets. The results support the hypothesis that both policies cannot be sustained in the long run. The conclusion is that a credible monetary policy aimed at inflation targets should be conducted in a free floating exchange rate regime.</description><author>Brenner, Menachem; Sokoler, Meir</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Apr 2010 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>An Experimental Test of the Impact of Overconfidence and Gender on Trading Activity</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Deaves, Richard; Lueders, Erik; Luo, Guo Ying
We perform an asset market experiment in order to investigate whether overconfidence induces trading. We investigate three manifestations of overconfidence: calibration-based overconfidence, the better-than-average effect and illusion of control. Novelly, the measure employed for calibration-based overconfidence is task-specific in that it is designed to influence behavior. We find that calibration-based overconfidence does engender additional trade, though the better-than-average also appears to play a role. This is true both at the level of the individual and also at the level of the market. There is little evidence that gender influences trading activity.</description><author>Deaves, Richard; Lueders, Erik; Luo, Guo Ying</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jul 2009 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Anything is Possible: On the Existence and Uniqueness of Equilibria in the Shleifer-Vishny Model of Limits of Arbitrage</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Arnold, Lutz G.
This paper characterizes equilibria in the Shleifer-Vishny model of limits of arbitrage. To prove existence, one has to consider types of equilibria ignored by Shleifer and Vishny, even if one adopts their parameter restrictions. For example, the only equilibrium may be one in which maximization of expected wealth requires an "all-or-nothing" investment strategy, with intermediate investment levels being strictly unprofitable. If one goes beyond Shleifer and Vishny's parameter restrictions, multiple equilibria may arise, and equilibrium selection may be governed by sunspots. Moreover, there may exist an equilibrium in which the asset price returns to fundamentals despite worsening noise trader sentiment.</description><author>Arnold, Lutz G.</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jul 2009 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>The Risk and Return of Arbitrage in Dual-Listed Companies</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>De Jong, Abe; Rosenthal, Leonard; Van Dijk, Mathijs A.
This paper evaluates investment strategies that exploit the deviations from theoretical price parity in a sample of 12 dual-listed companies (DLCs) in the period 1980-2002. We show that simple trading rules produce abnormal returns of up to almost 10% per annum adjusted for systematic risk, transaction costs, and margin requirements. However, arbitrageurs face uncertainty about the horizon at which prices will converge and deviations from parity are very volatile. As a result, DLC arbitrage is characterized by substantial idiosyncratic return volatility and a high incidence of large negative returns, which are likely to impede arbitrage.</description><author>De Jong, Abe; Rosenthal, Leonard; Van Dijk, Mathijs A.</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jul 2009 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Target-firm information asymmetry and acquirer returns</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Officer, Micah S.; Poulsen, Annette B.; Stegemoller, Mike

We find that US news affects Portuguese stock market returns, though less so when US stock market returns are included in the regression.

While the positive growth effects of financial integration are extensively documented, little is known of its impact on small and young firms. This paper aims to fill this void relying on a panel of 60,000 firm-year observations on listed and unlisted companies in Eastern European economies to assess the differential impact of foreign bank lending on firm growth and financing. Foreign lending stimulates growth in firm sales, assets, and use of financial debt even though the effect is dampened for small firms. More strikingly, young firms benefit most from foreign bank presence, while businesses connected to domestic banks or to the government suffer. Overall, our findings suggest that foreign banks can help to mitigate connected-lending problems and to improve capital allocation.</description><author>Giannetti, Mariassunta; Ongena, Steven</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Apr 2009 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>A Welfare Analysis of Regulation in Relationship Banking Markets</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Carlin, Bruce Ian; Rob, Rafael

We characterize the lending regimes that arise based on public policy, and evaluate the optimal choice by the government to induce particular lending practices to arise.

Bank deregulation and progress in information technology altered the geographical diffusion of banking structures and instruments, and reduced operational distance between banks and local economies. Although, the consolidation of the banking industry promoted the geographical concentration of banking decision-making centres and increased functional distance between local banking systems and local borrowers. This paper focuses on the impact that these spatial diffusion-concentration phenomena had on the financing constraints of Italian firms over the period 1996-2003.

We model separation of accounting from shopping allowed by credit cards, in a rational, dynamic game. When the shopper is more impatient than the accountant, selling assets to repay debt is not necessarily optimal, as the shopper can restore debt. Modest relative impatience generates asset-debt co-existence and target utilization rates, matching incidence and median assets of debt revolvers with substantial assets.

Compensation policy has become one of the most important ingredients of corporate governance. In this paper we take a new look at the issue, by contrasting the use of options with that of stock. We do this by integrating the repricing or resetting aspect of options with that of industrial structure. We show that industry competition may play an important role in dictating which form of compensation is optimal. When aggressive competition for key professional staff is an issue, the flexibility of options may actually become a disadvantage and therefore pure stock compensation may survive as an equilibrium. Thus compensation trends may be partly explained by trends in the nature of the competitive environment.</description><author>Stoughton, Neal M.; Wong, Kit Pong</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2009 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Managerial Incentives and Corporate Fraud: The Sources of Incentives Matter*</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Johnson, Shane A.; Ryan, Harley E.; Tian, Yisong S.

Fraud firms have significantly greater incentives from unrestricted stockholdings than control firms do, and unrestricted stockholdings are their largest incentive source. Our results emphasize the importance of the shape and vesting status of incentive payoffs in providing incentives to commit fraud.

The interactions of the corporate governance mechanisms with total pay-for-performance and excess compensation can be explained by governance substitution.

We show that institutions invest in private firms with governance mechanisms that tend to reduce the expected agency costs and risk of minority expropriation. Good governance mechanisms further allow institutional investors to enjoy the benefits of syndication and thereby reduce idiosyncratic risk.

The views on financial liberalization are quite conflictive. Many argue that it triggers financial bubbles and crises. Others claim that financial liberalization allows markets to function properly and capital to move to its most profitable destination. The empirical evidence on these effects is not robust. This paper constructs a new comprehensive chronology of financial liberalization and shows that a key reason for the inconclusive evidence is that the effects of liberalization are time-varying. Financial liberalization is followed by large booms and busts only in the short run. In the long run institutions improve and financial markets tend to stabilize.</description><author>Kaminsky, Graciela Laura; Schmukler, Sergio L.</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2008 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Cross-listing and firm growth</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Khurana, Inder K.; Martin, Xiumin; Periera, Raynolde
Extant research posits that cross-listing improves firms' access to lower cost external financing. But so far, there is scarce evidence that improved access to external funds through cross-listing contributes to higher firm growth. Documenting the relation between firm growth and cross-listing is critical because the presumption in prior research is that funds raised via cross-listing will be channeled towards potentially profitable projects. Using a sample of firms from thirty-seven countries that are cross-listed in the USA, we find a positive association between cross-listing and subsequent externally financed firm growth rates. However, we do not find that increases in externally financed firm growth after cross-listing vary systematically as a function of the home-country attributes of the cross-listed firms. Overall, our results provide new and direct evidence on the impact of cross-listing on the firm growth rates.</description><author>Khurana, Inder K.; Martin, Xiumin; Periera, Raynolde</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2008 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>An examination of heterogeneous beliefs with a short-sale constraint in a dynamic economy</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Gallmeyer, Michael; Hollifield, Burton
We study the effects of a market-wide short-sale constraint in a dynamic economy with heterogeneous beliefs. Imposing the constraint reduces the stock price if the optimistic investors' intertemporal elasticity of substitution (IES) is less than one and increases the stock price if the optimist's IES is greater than one. In calibrated examples, the optimist's market price of risk falls and the interest rate rises when the constraint binds. Imposing the constraint leads to a higher stock volatility if the optimist's IES is less than one and a lower stock volatility if the IES is greater than one.</description><author>Gallmeyer, Michael; Hollifield, Burton</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2008 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Understanding common factors in domestic and international bond spreads</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Martell, Rodolfo
I study the determinants of changes in credit spreads for US. dollar denominated domestic and foreign sovereign bonds using fundamentals specified by structural models to separate spreads into their credit and non-credit components. I find that the non-default portions of spreads have a component that is common for each type of debt. Further, using a vector autoregressive model, I find that domestic spreads are related to the lagged component of sovereign spreads. I also find that some proxies for liquidity are related to the common components, suggesting a liquidity-based explanation for the common component not identified by previous research.</description><author>Martell, Rodolfo</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2008 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Equity portfolio diversification</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Goetzmann, William N.; Kumar, Alok
This study shows that US. individual investors hold under-diversified portfolios, where the level of under-diversification is greater among younger, low-income, less-educated, and less-sophisticated investors. The level of under-diversification is also correlated with investment choices that are consistent with over-confidence, trend-following behavior, and local bias. Furthermore, investors who over-weight stocks with higher volatility and higher skewness are less diversified. In contrast, there is little evidence that portfolio size or transaction costs constrains diversification. Under-diversification is costly to most investors, but a small subset of investors under-diversify because of superior information.</description><author>Goetzmann, William N.; Kumar, Alok</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2008 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Are economists more likely to hold stocks?</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Christiansen, Charlotte; Joensen, Juanna Schroeter; Rangvid, Jesper
Using a large panel data set containing detailed information on educational attainments as well as financial and socioeconomic variables for individual investors, we show that economists are more likely to hold stocks than otherwise identical investors. First, we consider the change in stockholdings associated with (i) completing an economics education and (ii) an economist moving into the household. Second, we model stock market participation using a probit model with unobserved individual heterogeneity. Third, instrumental variables estimation allows us to identify the causal effect of an economics education on stock market participation. Throughout, we focus explicitly on the effect of a change in educational status on the likelihood of holding stocks.</description><author>Christiansen, Charlotte; Joensen, Juanna Schroeter; Rangvid, Jesper</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2008 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Informed traders as liquidity providers: Anonymity, liquidity and price formation</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Rindi, Barbara
The tendency to introduce anonymity into financial markets apparently runs counter to the theory supporting transparency. This paper studies the impact of pre-trade transparency on liquidity in a market where risk-averse traders accommodate the liquidity demand of noise traders. When some risk-averse investors become informed, an adverse selection problem ensues for the others, making them reluctant to supply liquidity. Hence the disclosure of traders' identities improves liquidity by mitigating adverse selection. However, informed investors are effective liquidity suppliers, as their adverse selection and inventory costs are minimized. With endogenous information acquisition, transparency reduces the number of informed investors, thus decreasing liquidity. The type of information that traders hold and the effectiveness of insider trading regulation are crucial to distinguish between equilibria.</description><author>Rindi, Barbara</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2008 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Suppressed negative information and future underperformance</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Scherbina, Anna
I present evidence of inefficient information processing in equity markets by documenting that negative information withheld by securities analysts is incorporated in stock prices with a significant delay. I estimate the extent of the withheld negative information based on the proportion of analysts who stop revising their annual earnings forecasts. This measure predicts negative earnings surprises and negative price reaction around earnings announcements. It could also be used to generate profitable trading strategies. I show that institutions tend to sell their stock holdings as my measure of unreported negative news increases, thus ameliorating the mispricing.</description><author>Scherbina, Anna</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2008 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Priming the risk attitudes of professionals in financial decision making</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Gilad, Dalia; Kliger, Doron
We explore the influence of priming on financial decisions by reinforcing subjects' risk-seeking behavior under uncertainty and comparing it to behavior in control groups. We focused on professionals: commercial banks' investment advisors and accountants in CPA firms. Results indicate that priming affects subjects' risk attitudes and investment decisions. Professionals' decisions were affected more than undergraduates', suggesting they employ a more intuitive and less analytic approach in making their decisions. Our work is related to field-data research documenting correlations between returns (investors' decisions) and situational factors, (i.e., weather) by suggesting controlled tests of professionals' behavior vis-a-vis the complexity inherent in field data.</description><author>Gilad, Dalia; Kliger, Doron</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2008 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Estimating the Costs of International Equity Investments</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Sercu, Piet; Vanpee, Rosanne
Generalizing Cooper-Kaplanis (1994), we estimate implied costs that reconcile international portfolios with InCAPM predictions. Costs depend on home- and host-country characteristics and on interactions; we estimate risk tolerance rather than pre-specifying it and we control for currency risk, inflation hedging, fixed-interest investments, round-tripping and omitted countries. Estimates for developed markets are lower than reported before, but those for new markets are quite high: 2001-2004 inward shadow costs range from 0.01 %p.a. (US) to 37 (Indonesia). We find that equity home bias is related to a mixture of risks and frictions, such as information asymmetries,</description><author>Sercu, Piet; Vanpee, Rosanne</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2008 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>A Dynamic Analysis of Growth via Acquisition</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Margsiri, Worawat; Mello, Antonio S.; Ruckes, Martin E.
Firms can grow through internal investment or through acquisition. While internal growth takes time, an acquisition provides cash flows immediately The opportunity to grow internally affects the price of an acquisition as it is a fall-back option for the acquirer should negotiations break down. Assuming investors do not have full information about the time a firm requires to grow internally, acquirers earn positive returns before the announcement of an acquisition, and there are negative stock price reactions to acquisition announcements. This research provides predictions about how pre-announcement price run-up and negative announcement returns relate to integration costs and synergies from acquisition.</description><author>Margsiri, Worawat; Mello, Antonio S.; Ruckes, Martin E.</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2008 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>The Optimality of Uniform Pricing in IPOs: An Optimal Auction Approach</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Bennouri, Moez; Falconieri, Sonia
This paper uses an optimal auction approach to investigate the conditions under which uniform pricing in IPOs is optimal. We show that the optimality of a uniform price in IPOs depends crucially on whether the (optimal) allocation rule is restricted. These restrictions may stein from the retail investors' budget constraint and/or from the institutional investors' preferences. We show that the main determinant of the optimality of a uniform pricing rule is the existence and the shape of the retail investors' budget constraint. In contrast. institutional investors' preferences are shown to mainly affect the optimal allocation rule.</description><author>Bennouri, Moez; Falconieri, Sonia</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2008 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Which Investors Leave Money on the Table?

This study documents patterns of investor behavior around Finnish rights issues. We find that shareholders of issuing companies lost at least is an element of 9.9 million in aggregate from 1995 to 2002 by exercising rights too early, selling rights in the open market below their intrinsic value, or leaving rights unexercised. At the investor level, the losses are modest. For example, the median household investor suffered a loss of is an element of 135 from not exercising or selling the rights. Investors with small portfolios, inactive trading history, those who know neither of the official languages in Finland, or who are living abroad leave money on the table the most.</description><author>Rantapuska, Elias; Knupfer, Samuli</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2008 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>One share-one vote: The empirical evidence</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Adams, Renee; Ferreira, Daniel
We survey the empirical literature on disproportional ownership, i.e. the use of mechanisms that separate voting rights from cash flow rights in corporations. Our focus is mostly on explicit mechanisms that allow some shareholders to acquire control with less than proportional economic interest in the firm (dual-class equity structures, stock pyramids, cross-ownership, etc.), but we also briefly discuss other mechanisms, such as takeover defenses and fiduciary voting. We provide a broad overview of different areas in this literature and highlight problems of interpretation that may arise because of empirical difficulties. We outline potentially promising areas for future research.</description><author>Adams, Renee; Ferreira, Daniel</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2008 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Special issue on corporate governance - Preface</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Allen, Franklin; Mayer, Colin; Pagano, Marco; Zechner, Josef

The theoretical literature on security-voting structure can be organized around three questions: What impact do nonvoting shares have on takeover outcomes? How does disproportional voting power affect the incentives of blockholders? What are the repercussions of mandating one share - one vote for firms' financing and ownership choices? Overall, the costs and benefits of separating cash flow and votes reflect the fundamental governance trade off between disempowering blockholders and empowering managers. It is therefore an open question whether mandating one share-one vote would improve the quality of corporate governance, notably in systems that so far relied on active owners.</description><author>Burkart, Mike; Lee, Samuel</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2008 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Should Insider Trading be Prohibited When Share Repurchases are Allowed?</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Buffa, Andrea M.; Nicodano, Giovanna
This paper considers share repurchases as the way long-term shareholders preserve their ability to use corporate information for Speculative purposes when insider trading regulation is enforced. This use of corporate information increases the adverse selection losses of short-term shareholders. Thus, buy-back programs reduce their incentive to invest in stocks that back the most productive technology, leading to a socially inefficient equilibrium. It follows that insider trading should not be banned when share repurchases are allowed. More generally, the paper argues that the regulation of insider trading and repurchases can not be considered in isolation, and analyzes their interplay.</description><author>Buffa, Andrea M.; Nicodano, Giovanna</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2008 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item></channel></rss>
