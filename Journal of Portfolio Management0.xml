Michael; Gordon, Jacques N.; Liang, Youguo; MacKinnon, Greg; Mansour, Asieh
In this article by the editors of this special issue, the authors discuss the changes being brought to real estate investment by new technology and how the other articles in the special issue nest into this broad theme. New technologies being applied specifically to property (proptech) are bringing changes to all aspects of commercial real estate, from construction to building management to investment to data collection. But, the authors argue, the greatest effect of new technology on commercial real estate investment will be from technology outside real estate and how it changes the way in which space is used by end users. Technology has already started to alter the way in which space is used and the types and locations of property being demanded. The authors argue that the ability to adopt technology into the investment process and adapt to how technology is changing the space market will be a key determinant of investment success in the future.</description><author>Clayton, Jim; Fabozzi, Frank J.; Giliberto, S.

Using performance data through the fourth quarter of 2017 on 467 funds that came to market between 2000 and 2013, the authors of this article first examine the unconditional performance of closed-end, private equity real estate (PERE) funds over time and across various fund characteristics. The performance metrics they use are the internal rate of return, the multiple on invested capital, and a proxy for the public market equivalent. Using conditional sorts, as well as regression procedures with asset pricing specifications, the authors estimate the exposure of PERE performance to fund-level characteristics and macroeconomic environment risk factors and find that both significantly affect PERE performance. More specifically, they find that PERE performance is positively related to fund size, gross domestic product growth changes, private market real estate returns, interest rate changes, and default spread changes and is negatively related to vintage volume. International funds dramatically underperformed relative to domestic funds during the sample period. The authors also find that fund performance is positively associated with the performance of prior funds raised by the same PERE firm.</description><author>Arnold, Thomas R.; Ling, David C.; Naranjo, Andy</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>AI and Machine Learning in Real Estate Investment</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Viriato, Jennifer Conway
The topic of artificial intelligence (AI) is seen frequently in popular media, academic journals, and corporate statements. However, real estate is an industry notoriously slow to adopt new technologies, and with new proptech (property technology) just beginning to open eyes to a whole new approach to investing, it is not yet clear where AI will have the most impact. Companies in the proptech space are beginning to use a variety of AI and machine learning (ML) techniques to enhance insights, productivity, and accuracy. The specific applications of these advancements and their transformative potential are explored in this article through in-depth conversations with technology investors, entrepreneurs, tech industry experts, and real estate professionals and are presented along with research on the latest literature and data on the companies and types of applications in this space. The current applications of AI and ML in real estate are broad and have important implications for how investors and other real estate professionals can incorporate technologies and new strategies into their decision making and operations.</description><author>Viriato, Jennifer Conway</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Default Prediction of Commercial Real Estate Properties Using Machine Learning Techniques</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Cowden, Chad; Fabozzi, Frank J.; Nazemi, Abdolreza
Academics and analysts have mostly employed stochastic and statistical default models to project defaults for properties backing commercial mortgage-backed securities. Although over the last few years there has been increased interest in using machine learning models to predict defaults on consumer loans, there has not been a comprehensive study that uses machine learning techniques to predict commercial real estate loan defaults. In this article, the authors investigate the use of machine learning techniques to predict defaults for commercial real estate property loans. The authors assess the performance of classification techniques based on machine learning (support vector machine, random forest, boosting, and classification tree) compared to the performance of the typical statistical technique. The principal findings of this study are that the support vector machine technique for predicting defaults on commercial property loans significantly outperforms other methods, and it has stable performance in imbalanced datasets. Moreover, the boosting technique identified the ratio of the capitalization rate spread to the average capitalization rate spread of property type as the most important driver of defaults in commercial real estate loans.</description><author>Cowden, Chad; Fabozzi, Frank J.; Nazemi, Abdolreza</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Multifamily Development: Can You Always Lease It Up?</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Fitzgerald, Mark; Zang, Chenchao; McIntosh, Will
Large institutional investors continue to view multifamily real estate favorably and raise their allocations to this sector. It is commonly perceived among institutional investors that multifamily- and multifamily development in particular-is a safer investment relative to other property sectors, a common refrain being "you can always lease it up." In this article, the authors attempt to validate this statement by examining the distribution of lease-up terms from initial lease-up to stabilization for multifamily developments delivered in the United States between 2008 and 2018. In addition, they investigate the impact of the length of the lease-up period on effective rents. Unfortunately, they do not have underwritten projections for each development to compare with subsequent performance as a mechanism to determine an investment's success. Despite this gap in the available data, the authors generally find support for the conventional wisdom; most developments are able to lease-up in a relatively expedient fashion, no matter the position in the economic/business cycle. However, effective rent change over the lease-up period varies significantly by point of cycle and lease-up term and is an important factor in the investment performance of multifamily developments.</description><author>Fitzgerald, Mark; Zang, Chenchao; McIntosh, Will</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Risk-Adjusted Attribution Analysis of Real Estate Portfolios</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Fisher, Jeffrey D.; D'Alessandro, Joseph
Comparing a fund or any portfolio's performance to a benchmark usually involves risk analysis and attribution analysis. Risk analysis considers measures such as beta and Jensen's alpha to determine if the portfolio is riskier than the benchmark. Attribution analysis decomposes the spread between the portfolio and the benchmark returns into components that are due to allocating the portfolio sector weights and selecting individual assets differently than the benchmark. These two types of analysis are typically done independently, with attribution analysis essentially assuming that there are no differences in risk between the portfolio and the benchmark. As a result, selection and allocation are applied to what is sometimes referred to as simple or nominal alpha, which is just the difference between the portfolio and benchmark return, ignoring risk. Some attempts have been made to combine the two, but none have done this in a way that is based on having attribution analysis apply to either Jensen's alpha (using beta as a risk adjustment) or Fama's beta, which relies only on relative standard deviations and adjusts for any additional risk resulting from not having a well-diversified portfolio. This article proposes a risk-adjusted performance attribution analysis that integrates risk measures with the Brinson models of attribution, which allows us to decompose the excess portfolio return into components of risk, allocation, selection, and net selectivity that is additive and consistent with financial theory. Risk-adjusted performance attribution can give us a quite different interpretation of which sectors contributed to better or worse performance relative to the benchmark. Traditional attribution analysis could result in a manager appearing to have done well in a sector where the higher return relative to the benchmark was due to taking on more risk. Alternatively, the manager could appear to have underperformed in a sector that was a less-risky sector. This is demonstrated using actual but masked open-end fund data as the manager portfolio compared to the NCREIF Property Index as the benchmark portfolio.</description><author>Fisher, Jeffrey D.; D'Alessandro, Joseph</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Another Look at Private Real Estate Returns by Strategy</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Bollinger, Mitchell A.; Pagliari, Joseph L.
This article examines the risk-adjusted, net-of-fee performance of noncore funds and generally finds that investors would have been better served by merely placing additional leverage on their core investments rather than investing in noncore assets. Using several datasets to create a mosaic-like view of the performance of private real estate investments, the authors find that over the 2000-2017 study period, value-added funds have, on average, generated an alpha of -3.26%; similarly, opportunistic funds have generated an alpha of -2.85%. Consequently, had investors in core funds used more leverage (loan-to-value ratios of 55% to 65%), they would have saved approximately $7.5 billion per year in unnecessary investment-management fees. The higher fees charged by these noncore funds were a material factor contributing to their negative alphas. Value-added funds charged approximately three times as much in fees as core funds, and opportunistic funds charged approximately four times as much. How and why these fee structures might change in the future is also explored. However, the fee differentials (relative to core funds) are insufficient to explain the entirety of the negative alpha associated with value-added and opportunistic investing. These conditions imply that noncore managers have, on average, overpaid for (and/or mismanaged) fund assets.</description><author>Bollinger, Mitchell A.; Pagliari, Joseph L.</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Environmental Performance of Commercial Real Estate: New Insights into Energy Efficiency Improvements</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Eichholtz, Piet; Holtermans, Rogier; Kok, Nils
This article provides new insights into the performance of commercial real estate, focusing on the environmental performance of institutional assets. The authors employ a proprietary dataset of energy consumption data that includes more than 26,000 buildings between 2009 and 2018. They document that, in their sample of commercial real estate, the median energy intensity decreased by more than 40% over the decade. Using a difference-in-difference analysis, the authors find that adoption of environmental building certification (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) is associated with significantly lower energy consumption and that there is substantial variation in these effects, depending on certification level and program, and label tenure. Moreover, specific interventions aimed at improving the energy efficiency of buildings considerably reduce ex post energy consumption, with effects varying based on local climatic conditions.</description><author>Eichholtz, Piet; Holtermans, Rogier; Kok, Nils</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Risk Reduction and Tracking Error in Small Commercial Real Estate Portfolios</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Reid, Bryan
Because of the extreme heterogeneity and lumpiness of commercial real estate, the topic of diversification and risk management has always attracted substantial interest, and a large body of work has been written on the subject. However, most of the analysis has focused on just a few markets, most notably the United Kingdom, or has been based on limited samples. This article uses asset-level data from over 9,000 office assets in the MSCI Global Annual Property Index to explore the performance of small portfolios (1 to 30 assets) over two separate five-year periods (20072011 and 2013-2017) in 16 national markets. The analysis focuses on small portfolios of fewer than 30 assets because many investors (even institutional investors and funds) have portfolios that are relatively small in terms of number of assets. The results provide a globally consistent overview of how asset correlations and market risk affected small commercial real estate portfolios and may have implications for the way investors and managers think about diversification in their exposures.</description><author>Reid, Bryan</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Real Estate in Mixed-Asset Portfolios for Various Investment Horizons</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Delfim, Jean-Christophe; Hoesli, Martin
In this article, the authors investigate the role of real estate in a mixed-asset portfolio for various investment horizons and notably extend the literature by considering together direct real estate, real estate investment trusts (REITs), and nonlisted real estate funds, as well as other alternative investments. Using US data spanning almost three decades, they report that medium-to long-term investors should allocate 10% to 20% of their portfolio to direct real estate. In contrast, short-term investors should focus on open-end core funds, which are found to be good substitutes for direct investments. REITs are usually of limited interest as a substitute for direct real estate, but they could be used in conjunction with direct investments for medium-and long-term horizons. Value-added and opportunistic closed-end funds are found to be imperfect substitutes for direct investments and are only marginally used. Finally, the authors find that including commodities, private equity, and hedge funds in a portfolio enhances the portfolio's performance but the allocation to real estate barely changes.</description><author>Delfim, Jean-Christophe; Hoesli, Martin</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Do Taxes Matter to Foreign Real Estate Investors? Evidence from FIRPTA Reform</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Howard, Margot; Pancak, Katherine A.
There is little research on whether foreign real estate investors respond to domestic taxes, which is somewhat ironic given that real estate is such a tax-driven industry. This article investigates the impact of taxes on foreign investment in real estate by exploring the response to 2015 reforms to the Foreign Investment in Real Property Tax Act of 1980, a unique section of the US Internal Revenue Code that imposes real estate income and capital gains withholding taxes on foreign investors. The new law exempts qualified foreign pension funds, with the effect of reducing capital gains withholding taxes by up to 35% depending on investor position and home country tax treaties. The authors find that this reform led to a five to seven percentage point increase in annual investment growth from pension funds in countries that experienced a tax rate decrease, relative to general trends in foreign pension fund investment in US real estate investment trusts. In addition, the results suggest that pension funds in those countries responded almost immediately.</description><author>Howard, Margot; Pancak, Katherine A.</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Quantitative Special Issue INTRODUCTION</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Fabozzi, Frank J.

In this article, the authors posit a quid pro quo in economic benefits between sell-side equity analysts and large hedge fund managers. They show that large hedge funds opportunistically trade one to four days prior to the publication of a recommendation change, a finding consistent with flow of information from analysts to hedge funds. Next, the authors demonstrate that in return for the information provided, analysts benefit from (1) better external evaluations and (2) higher trading commissions and fees for their brokerage firm. Notably, pre-trading occurs only when the analyst issuing the recommendations has a high external evaluation and the analyst's brokerage house is a prime broker to the hedge fund.</description><author>Klein, April; Saunders, Anthony; Wong, Yu Ting Forester</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Sep 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>The Price/Earnings Ratio, Growth, and Interest Rates: The Smartest BET</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Estep, Preston W.
The price/earnings ratio (PE) is the most ubiquitous measure of investment value. It appears to tell us how many years would be required for accumulated earnings to equal today's price (the break-even time [BET]), but that interpretation is built on unrealistic assumptions about a company's future: Earnings do not grow, or if they do grow, they are discounted at a rate equal to their growth. This article shows a simple formula that yields a correct computation of BET. A correct BET remedies the failings of PE, allowing valuation comparisons of stocks with widely different growth rates and PEs. Moreover, it provides useful information about the sensitivity of today's price to changes in interest rates or growth rates. BET is shown to be superior not only to simple PE but also to the ratio of PE to growth rate.</description><author>Estep, Preston W.</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Sep 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>On the Existence of Stock Price Bubbles-The Smoking Gun- Discounts and Premiums on Closed-End Funds and ETFs</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Jarrow, Robert
It is continually debated in the academic and professional literature whether stock prices exhibit or have exhibited bubbles. In this article the author argues that the persistence of closed-end fund (CEF) and exchange-traded fund (ETF) discounts and premiums, a phenomenon believed to be inexplicable by rational asset pricing theory, is due to the existence of stock price bubbles. Price bubbles in the stocks underlying the funds and in the market prices of the fund shares themselves generate the discounts and premiums. This rational asset pricing theory that explains the persistent of these discounts and premiums on CEFs and ETFs across both time and varying market conditions represents the proverbial smoking gun proving the existence of stock price bubbles.</description><author>Jarrow, Robert</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Sep 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Portfolio Selection: A Game-Theoretic Approach</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Simonian, Joseph
Game-theoretic methods are not widespread in finance. One reason is that practitioners do not see straightforward applications of game theory to core investment problems. To that end, in this article the author describes two novel portfolio construction applications of the game-theoretic solution concept known as the Shapley value. In the first, the Shapley value is used as a type of shrinkage operator to blend the allocation weights generated by two different portfolio selection frameworks. In the second, the Shapley value is used to build a unique approach to portfolio selection using what the author calls an optimization game. In both applications, asset classes are assumed to be the players who are bargaining over representation in a portfolio. As the article shows, the Shapley value naturally facilitates the construction of well-diversified portfolios that can satisfy specific investor goals without the need for additional formal constraints.</description><author>Simonian, Joseph</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Sep 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>International Equity Investing: Is Flexibility the New Diversification?</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Ramkumar, Sunder R.; Black, Michelle J.; Fu, Vincent C.
Global cross-country correlations have increased significantly across asset classes over the last two decades. This article documents systematic links between correlations of capital markets and the globalization of the real economy that suggest that higher correlations will persist and challenge the traditional role of international equities as a domestic diversifier. The authors argue that the case for international investing increasingly rests on the return potential from investing in a broad set of companies and that flexibility to invest across borders is key to capturing this value. They test this thesis with an empirical analysis of mutual funds and find that strategies with fewer geographical restrictions have indeed generated superior returns. The authors find benefits of flexibility in US funds that invest internationally, international funds that invest in the United States, international funds that invest in emerging markets and in global funds. Their results hold consistently in the ex post analysis of average and top-quartile strategies and when they use simple screens to identify and evaluate skillful managers. Interestingly, the authors find that improved results are driven by superior stock selection, as opposed to systematic regional tilts or market timing.</description><author>Ramkumar, Sunder R.; Black, Michelle J.; Fu, Vincent C.</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Sep 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>The Alpha, Beta, and Sigma of ESG: Better Beta, Additional Alpha?</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Jacobsen, Brian; Lee, Wai; Ma, Chao
Rather than treat investments as statistical objects to be optimally combined into portfolios, investors are increasingly interested in the environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) dimensions of their investments. Analysts traditionally evaluated these dimensions in qualitative ways, but many data providers are attempting to score these dimensions, effectively quantifying what was qualitative. For developed market equities, on the basis of one popular data provider's ESG assessment, we evaluate the evidence on whether portfolios of highly rated ESG stocks are materially different from their complements (non-ESG stocks) in their investment opportunity sets. It is obvious that ESG stocks dyer from non-ESG stocks in their ESG dimensions, but we show that ESG stocks returns are also different. Although the total return-to-total risk of ESG stocks may be lower than that for non-ESG stocks, after factor-adjusting the returns and risks, portfolios of ESG stocks with positive alpha have return-to-risk features comparable to those of portfolios of non-ESG stocks with positive alpha. For portfolios without statistically significant alpha, the portfolios of ESG stocks have lower residual volatility than portfolios of non-ESG stocks. It should be possible, by factor-neutralizing portfolios, to build better beta with comparable alpha portfolios by using ESG factors.</description><author>Jacobsen, Brian; Lee, Wai; Ma, Chao</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Sep 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Integrating Factors in Market Indexes and Active Portfolios</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Melas, Dimitris; Nagy, Zoltan; Kumar, Navneet; Zangari, Peter
In this article, the authors review factor performance in global equity markets using coherent data and methodology and apply a new template to evaluate their backtests for potential selection bias under multiple testing. They then propose a systematic process for integrating factor information into different investment strategies. The authors show that this process is consistent with the Black-Litterman framework and test it on a sample of market indexes and active equity portfolios. Integrating factors in indexes improved risk-adjusted performance while retaining high liquidity and capacity. Adding factors to active strategies enhanced information ratios while maintaining the portfolio characteristics and stock selection alpha of the original strategies. The authors' analysis may have important implications for different types of investors. Asset owners may be able to tilt reference indexes toward rewarded factors without sacrificing market coverage and diversification. Index managers can track factor-tilted indexes because they remain investable and replicable. Finally, active managers may be able to incorporate factor information into their strategies to harvest factor premiums while preserving their core investment process and the added value from fundamental security selection.</description><author>Melas, Dimitris; Nagy, Zoltan; Kumar, Navneet; Zangari, Peter</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Sep 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>The Capacity of Factor Strategies</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Blitz, David; Marchesini, Thom
The rapidly growing popularity of factor investing raises questions about the capacity of factor-based strategies. In this article, the authors show that widely used factor indexes face severe capacity constraints as a result of concentrating all their trades on just a handful of rebalancing moments each year. They argue that the key to unlocking a high capacity is efficiently using the liquidity offered by the market throughout the year. This is illustrated with a simulation experiment in which the trades of standard factor indexes are simply spread over a longer period. Although this naive approach uses stale information, no loss in performance is observed and trade feasibility, and hence capacity, show spectacular improvement.</description><author>Blitz, David; Marchesini, Thom</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Sep 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Macroeconomic Risks in Equity Factor Investing</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Amenc, Noel; Esakia, Mikheil; Goltz, Felix; Luyten, Ben
There is a consensus that equity factors are cyclical and depend on macroeconomic conditions. To build well-diversified portfolios of factors, one needs to account for the fact that different factors may have similar dependencies on macroeconomic conditions. The authors provide a protocol for selecting relevant macroeconomic state variables that reflect changes in expectations about the aggregate economy. They show that returns of standard equity factors depend significantly on such state variables. Factor returns also depend on aggregate macroeconomic regimes reflecting good and bad times. These macroeconomic risks have strong portfolio implications. For example, some equity factors depend on interest rate risk. Investors who already have exposure to this risk through bond investments may increase loss risk when tilting to the wrong equity factors. The authors also show that standard multifactor allocations do not sufficiently address macroeconomic conditionality. Combining factors may not reduce macroeconomic risks even for factors with low correlation. Understanding macroeconomic risks is a prerequisite both for risk transparency and for improving diversification of equity factor investments.</description><author>Amenc, Noel; Esakia, Mikheil; Goltz, Felix; Luyten, Ben</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Sep 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>The Size Effect Is Alive and Well, and Hiding behind Calendar Anomalies</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Aharon, David Yechiam; Qadan, Mahmoud
Empirical evidence from the literature documents that the size effect has gradually diminished since the early 1980s. In this article, the authors examine the stability of this anomaly between 1926 and 2014. The evidence they document indicates a substantial presence of the size effect across various calendar anomalies. The anomalies considered are the January effect, the Halloween effect, the Mark Twain effect, the other January effect, the seasonal affective disorder effect, and the turn-of-the-month, day-of-the-week, and week-of-the-year effects. Their findings hold true for different sample periods, various modeling specifications, and types of returns and may provide investment professionals such as portfolio managers, investment officers, analysts, and other market participants with a practical tool for their daily decision-making.</description><author>Aharon, David Yechiam; Qadan, Mahmoud</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Sep 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Bond-Market Risk Factors and Manager Performance</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Mladina, Peter; Germani, Steven
The authors introduce a novel approach for jointly testing bond-market factor models and bond manager performance using the attributes of market efficiency as an ideal, or benchmark. In addition to proposing enhanced constructions of term and default factors, they find evidence for a prepayment risk factor. They also find that style premiums do not materially reduce alphas or explain much additional common variation in the returns of traded bond portfolios when they are added to term, default, and prepayment risk factors. A factor model with just term, default, and prepayment risk factors performs as well, but is more parsimonious and employs clear sources of systematic risk. The authors find evidence of factor-adjusted alpha in a very small subset of active bond managers.</description><author>Mladina, Peter; Germani, Steven</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Sep 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>The Best of Strategies for the Worst of Times: Can Portfolios Be Crisis Proofed?</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Harvey, Campbell R.; Hoyle, Edward; Rattray, Sandy; Sargaison, Matthew; Taylor, Dan; Van Hemert, Otto
In the late stages of long bull markets, a popular question arises: What steps can an investor take to mitigate the impact of the inevitable large equity correction? Hedging equity portfolios is notoriously difficult and expensive. In this article, the authors analyze the performance of different tools that investors could deploy. For example, continuously holding short-dated S&amp;P 500 put options is the most reliable defensive method but also the most costly strategy. Holding safe-haven US Treasury bonds produces a positive carry but may be an unreliable crisis-hedge strategy because the post-2000 negative bond-equity correlation is a historical rarity. Long gold and long credit protection portfolios sit between puts and bonds in terms of both cost and reliability. Dynamic strategies that performed well during past drawdowns include futures time-series momentum (which benefits from extended equity sell-offs) and a quality strategy that takes long (short) positions in the highest (lowest) quality company stocks (which benefits from a flight-to-quality effect during crises). The authors examine both large equity drawdowns and recessions. They also provide some out-of-sample evidence of the defensive performance of these strategies relative to an earlier, related article.</description><author>Harvey, Campbell R.; Hoyle, Edward; Rattray, Sandy; Sargaison, Matthew; Taylor, Dan; Van Hemert, Otto</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jul 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Risk and Reward in the Orphan Drug Industry</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Lo, Andrew W.; Thakor, Richard T.
Thanks to a combination of scientific advances and economic incentives, the development of therapeutics to treat rare or orphan diseases has grown dramatically in recent years. With the advent of Food and Drug Administration-approved gene therapies and the promise of gene editing, many experts believe we are at an inflection point in dealing with these afflictions. In this article, the authors propose to document this inflection point by measuring the risk and reward of investing in the orphan drug industry. They construct a stock market index of 39 publicly traded companies that specialize in developing drugs for orphan diseases and compare the financial performance of this index, which they call ORF, to the broader biopharmaceutical industry and the overall stock market from 2000 to 2015. Although the authors report that ORF underperformed other bio-pharma companies and the overall stock market in the early 2000s, its performance has improved over time: from 2010 to 2015, ORF returned 608%, far exceeding the 317%, 320%, and 305% returns of the S&amp;P, NASDAQ, and NYSE ARCA Bio-tech indexes, respectively, and the 83% of the S&amp;P 500. ORF does have higher volatility than the other indexes but still outperforms even on a risk-adjusted basis, with a Sharpe ratio of 1.24 versus Sharpe ratios of 1.17, 1.14, and 1.05, respectively, for the other three biotech indexes and 0.71 for the S&amp;P 500. However, ORF has a market beta of 1.16, which suggests significant correlation to the aggregate stock market and less diversification benefits than traditional pharmaceutical investments.</description><author>Lo, Andrew W.; Thakor, Richard T.</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jul 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Crowded Trades: Implications for Sector Rotation and Factor Timing</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Kinlaw, William; Kritzman, Mark; Turkington, David
Crowded trades are often associated with bubbles. If investors can locate a bubble sufficiently early, they can profit from the run-up in prices. But to profit from a bubble, investors must exit the bubble before the sell-off erodes all of the profits. The authors propose two measures for managing exposure to bubbles. One measure, called asset centrality, locates crowded trading, which they show is often associated with the formation of bubbles. The other is a measure of relative value, which helps to separate crowding that occurs during a bubble's run-up from crowding that occurs during a bubble's sell-off. Neither measure by itself is sufficient for identifying the full cycle of a bubble, but the authors show that together these measures have the potential to locate bubbles in sectors and in factors as they begin to emerge and to identify exit points before they fully deflate.</description><author>Kinlaw, William; Kritzman, Mark; Turkington, David</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jul 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>The Size Premium in Equity Markets: Where Is the Risk?</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Ciliberti, Stefano; Serie, Emmanuel; Simon, Guillaume; Lemperiere, Yves; Bouchaud, Jean-Philippe
The authors find that when measured in terms of dollar-turnover, and once beta and low volatility (low-vol) is neutralized, the size effect is alive and well. With a long-term t-statistic of 5.1, the cold-minus-hot (CMH) anomaly is certainly not less significant than other well-known factors such as value or quality. As compared to market-cap-based SMB, the authors report that CMH portfolios are much less anti-correlated to the low-vol anomaly. In contrast with standard risk premiums, size-based portfolios are found by the authors to be virtually unskewed. In fact, they report that the extreme risk of these portfolios is dominated by the large-cap leg; small caps actually have a positive (rather than negative) skewness. The only argument that the authors find favors a risk premium interpretation at the individual stock level is that the extreme drawdowns are more frequent for small-cap/turnover stocks, even after accounting for volatility. According to the authors, however, this idiosyncratic risk is clearly diversifiable and should not, in theory, generate higher returns.</description><author>Ciliberti, Stefano; Serie, Emmanuel; Simon, Guillaume; Lemperiere, Yves; Bouchaud, Jean-Philippe</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jul 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Foundations of ESG Investing: How ESG Affects Equity Valuation, Risk, and Performance</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Giese, Guido; Lee, Linda-Eling; Melas, Dimitris; Nagy, Zoltan; Nishikawa, Laura
Many studies have focused on the relationship between companies with strong environmental, social, and governance (ESG) characteristics and corporate financial performance. However, these have often struggled to show that positive correlations-when produced-can in fact explain the behavior. The authors of this article provide a link between ESG information and the valuation and performance of companies, by examining three transmission channels within a standard discounted cash flow model-which they call the cash-flow channel, the idiosyncratic risk channel, and the valuation channel. They tested each of these transmission channels using Morgan Stanley Capital International ESG Ratings data and financial variables. This showed that companies' ESG information was transmitted to their valuation and performance, both through their systematic risk profile (lower costs of capital and higher valuations) and their idiosyncratic risk profile (higher profitability and lower exposures to tail risk). The research suggests that changes in a company's ESG characteristics may be a useful financial indicator. ESG ratings may also be suitable for integration into policy benchmarks and financial analyses.</description><author>Giese, Guido; Lee, Linda-Eling; Melas, Dimitris; Nagy, Zoltan; Nishikawa, Laura</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jul 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>And the Winner Is...

The authors evaluate and compare the usefulness of various valuation ratios for equity country allocation. To this end, the performance of 73 national equity indexes is investigated for the period 1996 to 2017. The earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) to- enterprise value (EV) multiple is the best predictor of performance and outperforms other metrics. An equal-weighted portfolio that is long (short) in the tertile of countries with the highest (lowest) EBITDA-to-EV ratio produces a mean monthly return of 0.69% and a Sharpe ratio of 0.81, which is more than double the Sharpe ratios obtained from using traditional metrics such as the book-to-market ratio or dividend yield. Two major drawbacks of intercountry value strategies are identified: (1) pay-offs are derived predominantly from emerging and frontier markets and (2) profitability has significantly declined in the last decade.</description><author>Zaremba, Adam; Szczygielski, Jan Jakub</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jul 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Protecting the Downside of Trend When It Is Not Your Friend</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Yang, Kun; Qian, Edward; Belton, Bryan
Simple trend-following strategies have been documented as cost-effective, transparent alternatives to the hedge-fund style managed futures strategies. Although largely capturing the returns of the managed futures industry, those simple strategies may periodically suffer significant losses due to oversimplified trend signals and underdiversified portfolio construction. In this article, the authors show that trend-following strategies with moderate sophistication and better diversification can significantly reduce the downside risk of simple trend-following strategies without sacrificing much upside potential. The authors therefore recommend that investors who seek the benefits of cost-effective trend-following strategies consider adding reasonable complexity to the strategies.</description><author>Yang, Kun; Qian, Edward; Belton, Bryan</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jul 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Valuation Bias and Limits to Nudges</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Shefrin, Hersh
Because of limits to arbitrage, it is reasonable for sell-side analysts' target prices to deviate from their corresponding estimates of future fundamental value. Although this inequality does not imply that sell-side analysts should provide biased estimates of fundamental value, many do. According to the author, a key contributor to this bias is making an unwarranted assumption that in the long run firms can be expected to earn more than their cost of capital. Biased estimates of fundamental value can harm long-term investors. At the same time, the author explains in this article that there are simple nudges that can help avoid the bias. Nevertheless, limits to nudges associated with buy-side catering prevent their application. The magnitude of the associated bias can be substantial for the stocks of large firms that dominate the market. Notably, sell-side analysts' upwardly biased estimated fundamental values for these stocks lie in the vicinity of consensus target prices and market prices. According to the author, this suggests that valuation bias associated with stocks of large firms that dominate the market is consistent with intermittent overvaluation of these stocks and the overall market.</description><author>Shefrin, Hersh</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jul 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Accelerating Learning in Active Management: The Alpha-Brier Process</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Cerniglia, Joseph A.; Tetlock, Philip E.
Forecasting tournaments have shown it is possible to improve the accuracy of forecasts of real-world events that sophisticated observers often supposed are too idiosyncratic to be pinned down by numerical probabilities. Building on this research program, the authors propose the Alpha-Brier process to help firms improve forecasts guiding investment decisions. Alpha-Brier offers four major benefits: (1) It reduces the noisiness of vague-verbiage forecasts, such as X "might" or "could" happen, that are open to varying interpretations; (2) it makes it easier to distinguish skill from luck as drivers of portfolio performance; (3) it gives investors faster feedback on the accuracy of their probability judgments; and (4) it lets managers test which methods of training, incentivizing, and aggregating judgments deliver the biggest boosts to accuracy. Paradoxically, the more pervasive the skepticism toward the core premise of Alpha-Brier that probability judgments can be extended to superficially unique events, the more opportunities there will be for firms to exploit market inefficiencies linked to overreliance on vague-verbiage forecasts.</description><author>Cerniglia, Joseph A.; Tetlock, Philip E.</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jul 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>"Flexicure" Retirement Solutions: A Part of the Answer to the Pension Crisis?</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Martellini, Lionel; Milhau, Vincent; Mulvey, John
Individuals preparing for retirement are currently left with an unsatisfactory choice between security with no flexibility with annuity products and flexibility without security with investment products such as balanced funds or target date funds. To get out of this impasse, the authors introduce a range of flexicure retirement goal-based investing strategies that offer both security and flexibility with respect to the objective of generating replacement income in decumulation. Recent advances in financial engineering and digital technologies make it possible to apply goal-based investing principles to a much broader population of investors than the few traditional clients who can afford customized mandates or private banking services, which suggests that these flexicure retirement solutions can be used as part of the solution to the global pension crisis.</description><author>Martellini, Lionel; Milhau, Vincent; Mulvey, John</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jul 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Scaling and Adaptive Asset Allocation</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Wilcox, Jarrod
