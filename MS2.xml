Growing evidence shows that biological factors affect individual financial decisions that could be reflected in financial markets. Testosterone, a chemical messenger especially influential in male physiology, has been shown to affect economic decision making and is taken as a performance enhancer among some financial professionals. This is the first experimental study to test how testosterone causally affects trading and prices. We exogenously elevated testosterone in male traders and tested testosterone's effect both on their trading behavior in experimental asset markets and on the size and duration of asset price bubbles. Using both aggregated and individual trading data, we find that testosterone administration generated larger and longer-lasting bubbles by causing high bids and the slow incorporation of the asset's fundamental value.</description><author>Nadler, Amos; Jiao, Peiran; Johnson, Cameron J.; Alexander, Veronika; Zak, Paul J.</author><pubDate>Sat, 01 Sep 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>I Lie? We Lie! Why? Experimental Evidence on a Dishonesty Shift in Groups</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Kocher, Martin G.; Schudy, Simeon; Spantig, Lisa
Unethical behavior such as dishonesty, cheating and corruption occurs frequently in organizations or groups. Recent experimental evidence suggests that there is a stronger inclination to behave immorally in groups than individually. We ask if this is the case, and if so, why. Using a parsimonious laboratory setup, we study how individual behavior changes when deciding as a group member. We observe a strong dishonesty shift. This shift is mainly driven by communication within groups and turns out to be independent of whether group members face payoff commonality or not (i.e., whether other group members benefit from one's lie). Group members come up with and exchange more arguments for being dishonest than for complying with the norm of honesty. Thereby, group membership shifts the perception of the validity of the honesty norm and of its distribution in the population.</description><author>Kocher, Martin G.; Schudy, Simeon; Spantig, Lisa</author><pubDate>Sat, 01 Sep 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Forecasting Corporate Bond Returns with a Large Set of Predictors: An Iterated Combination Approach</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Lin, Hai; Wu, Chunchi; Zhou, Guofu
Using a comprehensive return data set and an array of 27 macroeconomic, stock, and bond predictors, we find that corporate bond returns are highly predictable based on an iterated combination model. The large set of predictors outperforms traditional predictors substantially, and predictability generated by the iterated combination is both statistically and economically significant. Stock market and macroeconomic variables play an important role in forming expected bond returns. Return forecasts are closely linked to the evolution of real economy. Corporate bond premia have strong predictive power for business cycle, and the primary source of this predictive power is from the low-grade bond premium.</description><author>Lin, Hai; Wu, Chunchi; Zhou, Guofu</author><pubDate>Sat, 01 Sep 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Explaining Momentum and Value Simultaneously</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Li, Jun
This paper proposes a unified risk-based explanation for momentum profits and the value premium in a neoclassical investment-based model. Winner firms have higher short-term productivity and hence more negative exposures to the price of investment goods than loser firms as a result of greater investment plans. Value firms have lower long-term productivity and higher operating leverage and hence higher sensitivities to neutral productivity shocks than growth firms. The model reproduces the coexistence of momentum profits and the value premium, the failure of the unconditional capital asset pricing model, the predictability of momentum profits by market states, and the long-term reversal of momentum profits. Empirical tests confirm a negative price of risk for the shock to the relative price of investment goods.</description><author>Li, Jun</author><pubDate>Sat, 01 Sep 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Management of Reported and Forecast EPS, Investor Responses, and Research Implications</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Cheong, Foong Soon; Thomas, Jacob
We document substantial management of reported and forecast earnings per share (EPS) for analyst-followed U.S. firms, with the extent of management increasing with share price. Managers smooth the volatility of reported EPS by using accruals to offset cash flow shocks. Smoother EPS is easier to forecast, resulting in smaller forecast errors. Managers also differentially guide forecasts to improve accuracy. Whereas unmanaged forecast errors are much larger for high-price firms, they are compressed to the point their magnitudes resemble those for low-price firms. Managers also guide analyst forecasts to generate patterns of forecast walkdowns that again vary with share price. Given the remarkable level of management implied by our results, we conduct additional robustness analyses. The strongest evidence is observed in stock price responses: investors recognize efforts to manage reported and forecast EPS and adjust accordingly. We highlight potential biases caused by researchers being unaware of managerial efforts and investor responses, and offer ways to mitigate those biases.</description><author>Cheong, Foong Soon; Thomas, Jacob</author><pubDate>Sat, 01 Sep 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>A Reinterpretation of the Optimal Demand for Risky Assets in Fund Separation Theorems</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Deguest, Romain; Martellini, Lionel; Milhau, Vincent
In a continuous-time portfolio selection model with N risky assets and K state variables driving their risk and return parameters, we derive simple expressions for the allocation to each asset in the K + 1 risky funds of the (K + 2)-fund separation theorem. We show that the allocation to any given risky asset in each fund can be written in terms of the parameters of a regression of the excess returns of this asset on those of the N - 1 remaining assets. We also use these parameters to provide quantitative measures of the increase in Sharpe ratio of the speculative demand, or in the maximum correlation of each hedging demand with respect to the corresponding risk factor, associated with the introduction of a new asset in the investment universe. Finally, we show that in a multiperiod setting, an asset is "spanned" by others if and only if it improves neither the maximum Sharpe ratio of the speculative demand nor the maximum correlations of the hedging demands with the risk factors.</description><author>Deguest, Romain; Martellini, Lionel; Milhau, Vincent</author><pubDate>Sat, 01 Sep 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>The Foreign Investor Bias and Its Linguistic Origins</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Lundholm, Russell; Rahman, Nafis; Rogo, Rafael
We study how misaligned language between the investor and the firm contributes to the underweighting of foreign securities in an international portfolio. In particular, we document a significant U.S. institutional investor bias against firms located in Quebec relative to firms located in the rest of Canada (ROC). The differential bias is surprising given that (i) Quebec and the other Canadian provinces share the same nationality, federal law, stock exchange, and accounting standards; (ii) their regulatory filings are prepared in English and French; and (iii) U.S. institutional investors are sophisticated and located close to Quebec and the ROC. We also examine Quebec firms with different levels of French versus English online presences as well as those with CEOs who have U.S. work experience or board members or financial analysts who reside in the United States. We find that each factor affects the relative underweighting of investment in Quebec versus the ROC. Finally, we contrast the holdings of institutional investors located in the United Kingdom and France to bolster our conclusion that incongruent languages contribute to the underweighting of Quebec firms relative to firms in the ROC.</description><author>Lundholm, Russell; Rahman, Nafis; Rogo, Rafael</author><pubDate>Sat, 01 Sep 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Managerial Incentives to Increase Risk Provided by Debt, Stock, and Options</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Anderson, Joshua D.; Core, John E.
We measure a manager's risk-taking incentives as the total sensitivity of the manager's debt, stock, and option holdings to firm volatility. We compare this measure with the option vega and with the relative measures used by the prior literature. Vega does not capture risk-taking incentives from managers' stock and debt holdings and does not reflect the fact that employee options are warrants. The relative measures do not incorporate the sensitivity of options to volatility. Our new measure explains risk choices better than vega and the relative measures and should be useful for future research on managers' risk choices.</description><author>Anderson, Joshua D.; Core, John E.</author><pubDate>Sat, 01 Sep 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Discretionary Task Ordering: Queue Management in Radiological Services</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Ibanez, Maria R.; Clark, Jonathan R.; Huckman, Robert S.; Staats, Bradley R.
Work scheduling research typically prescribes task sequences implemented by managers. Yet employees often have discretion to deviate from their prescribed sequence. Using data from 2.4 million radiological diagnoses, we find that doctors prioritize similar tasks (batching) and those tasks they expect to complete faster (shortest expected processing time). Moreover, they exercise more discretion as they accumulate experience. Exploiting random assignment of tasks to doctors' queues, instrumental variable models reveal that these deviations erode productivity. This productivity decline lessens as doctors learn from experience. Prioritizing the shortest tasks is particularly detrimental to productivity. Actively grouping similar tasks also reduces productivity, in stark contrast to productivity gains from exogenous grouping, indicating deviation costs outweigh benefits from repetition. By analyzing task completion times, our work highlights the trade-offs between the time required to exercise discretion and the potential gains from doing so, which has implications for how discretion over scheduling should be delegated.</description><author>Ibanez, Maria R.; Clark, Jonathan R.; Huckman, Robert S.; Staats, Bradley R.</author><pubDate>Sat, 01 Sep 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Gift Exchange in the Workplace: Addressing the Conflicting Evidence with a Careful Test</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Esteves-Sorenson, Constanca
Tests of gift exchange, wherein agents receive excess wages which are noncontingent on performance in one-shot settings, have yielded contradictory evidence: they sometimes find effort boosts, consistent with gift exchange, whereas they sometimes find no effort increases, consistent with a standard model. We identify eight confounds that could have led to the mixed evidence-agent disutility from being viewed as selfish, small samples, insufficient wage raises, an effort ceiling, fatigue, selection of abler workers, reemployment concerns, and peer effects-and run a comprehensive test addressing them. Our test consisted of a field experiment hiring workers for a data entry job, followed by laboratory games assessing their prosocial behavior. After addressing these confounds, we find that behavior during the field test was consistent with a standard model: workers did not repay fixed wage raises with an effort boost, but they did raise effort in response to a piece rate. The piece-rate scheme was also more efficient: the effort boost came at lower expense than paying fixed wage raises. Further, workers who behaved prosocially in laboratory games did not behave prosocially in the field.</description><author>Esteves-Sorenson, Constanca</author><pubDate>Sat, 01 Sep 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Supporting Tax Policy Change Through Accounting Discretion: Evidence from the 2012 Elections</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Baloria, Vishal P.; Klassen, Kenneth J.
Some corporations attempt to lessen their tax burden through involvement in the legislative process. We identify firms that contributed to congressional candidates who favor reductions in the U.S. corporate statutory tax rate. This support created a temporary incentive to manage effective tax rates (ETRs) up. We document that these firms increased their reported effective tax rate in the two calendar quarters preceding the 2012 election relative to adjacent periods and other firms supporting candidates in the same election. We find that the variation in upward ETR management is correlated with firm-level proxies for potential reputational costs, capital markets costs, and long-run tax burdens. The variation in upward ETR management is also correlated with firm-candidate-level proxies for strength of relationships and competitiveness of election races. Our findings provide new evidence on accounting choices in support of corporate political activity and on the political cost hypothesis in the tax setting.</description><author>Baloria, Vishal P.; Klassen, Kenneth J.</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Oct 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Financial Regulatory Reform After the Crisis: An Assessment</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Duffie, Darrell
This is a survey of progress with the postcrisis global (G20) reform of the financial system, in five key areas of new regulation: (1) making financial institutions more resilient; (2) ending "too-big-to-fail"; (3) making derivatives markets safer; (4) transforming shadow banking; and (5) improving trade competition and market transparency. The resiliency reforms, particularly bank capital regulations, have been increasingly successful in improving financial stability, but have been accompanied by some reduction in secondary-market liquidity. I review specific areas where reforms are far from complete, or have even been counterproductive.</description><author>Duffie, Darrell</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Oct 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Editorial Statement-Accounting</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Bushee, Brian; Srinivasan, Suraj

Despite the "1/N problem" associated with profit sharing, the empirical literature finds that sharing profits with workers has a positive impact on work team and firm performance. We examine one possible resolution to this puzzle by observing that, although the incentive to work harder under profit sharing is weak, it might be sufficient to motivate workers to report each other for shirking, especially if the workers are reciprocally minded. Our model provides the rationale for this conjecture, and we discuss the results of an experiment finding that workers who share in firm profits are more willing to provide accurate information about their peers to management and that profit sharing is most effective when peer reporting is possible.</description><author>Carpenter, Jeffrey; Robbett, Andrea; Akbar, Prottoy A.</author><pubDate>Sat, 01 Sep 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Lower Price or Higher Reward? Measuring the Effect of Consumers' Preferences on Reward Programs</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Rossi, Federico
Despite criticisms regarding their effectiveness, reward programs today represent a prevalent and apparently successful form of marketing investment for several industries such as airlines, hotels, gas stations, and credit cards. To understand what might contribute to their success, this paper investigates the purchase behavior of consumers who participate in a reward program from the travel industry. We estimate a dynamic demand model of gasoline purchase, and compare the value that consumers attach to rewards with the value they attach to the money spent for gasoline. We find that there exists a significant portion of frequent travelers who extract more value from one dollar's worth of rewards than from one dollar spent for gasoline. Most of the effectiveness of the reward program is due to the behavior of these consumers. Their insensitivity to price induces firms to increase fuel prices by 1 euro cent per liter, which corresponds to about 10% increase in their margins. The program also contributes to softening competition, increasing margins by 4%.</description><author>Rossi, Federico</author><pubDate>Sat, 01 Sep 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Microgeography and the Direction of Inventive Activity</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Catalini, Christian
I provide novel empirical evidence grounded in an original theoretical framework to explain why colocation matters for the rate, direction, and quality of scientific collaboration. To address endogeneity concerns due to selection into colocation and matching, I exploit the constraints imposed on the spatial allocation of labs on the Jussieu campus of Paris by the removal of asbestos from its buildings. Consistent with search costs constituting a major friction to collaboration, colocation increases the likelihood of joint research by 3.5 times, an effect that is mostly driven by lab pairs that face higher search costs ex ante. Furthermore, separation does not negatively affect collaboration between previously colocated labs. However, while colocated labs grow increasingly similar in topics and literature cited, separated ones embark on less correlated research trajectories. Research outcomes, instead, seem to be mostly influenced by how distance affects execution costs: after colocation, labs are more likely to pursue both lower-quality projects (a selection effect) and high-quality projects (an effort effect). Opposite effects on quality are observed after separation. Whereas search costs affect which scientists are likely to collaborate together, execution costs shape the quality of their output.</description><author>Catalini, Christian</author><pubDate>Sat, 01 Sep 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Speculative Equilibrium with Differences in Higher-Order Beliefs</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Han, Jungsuk; Kyle, Albert S.
Modest differences in higher-order beliefs may have large price effects. We generalize a standard rational expectations equilibrium model with different information by allowing differences in higher-order beliefs. Investors have possibly different dogmatic beliefs about the mean, different dogmatic beliefs about other investors' beliefs, and so on for higher and higher orders of beliefs. Even when every investor's first-order expectations are unbiased, overvaluation results when investors have inconsistent higher-order beliefs that their own expectations are more optimistic than average. This lack of common knowledge destabilizes prices in an unbounded manner as market liquidity disappears.</description><author>Han, Jungsuk; Kyle, Albert S.</author><pubDate>Sat, 01 Sep 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Reference-Dependent Utility, Product Variety, and Price Competition</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Amaldoss, Wilfred; He, Chuan
Products such as Nike running shoes, Gillette razors, and Gatorade sports drink serve as the standard against which consumers evaluate other members of the category. Empirical evidence suggests that consumers care about not only the consumption utility derived from a product, but also the gain-loss utility in comparison to the reference product of the category. This paper examines how reference-dependent utility affects price competition in a horizontally differentiated market where consumers' tastes are diverse. When consumer valuations are low, the reference product is priced lower than a nonreference product. In contrast, when consumer valuations are high, the reference product is priced higher than a nonreference product. Moreover, loss aversion on the price dimension always intensifies competition among low-valuation goods, whereas loss aversion on the taste dimension softens competition among high-valuation goods only if consumer sensitivity to the difference in match quality is above a threshold. We also find that an increase in the diversity of consumers' tastes reduces equilibrium profits if consumer valuation is low but has the opposite effect if consumer valuation is high. We further explore how an increase in the popularity of the reference product affects price competition. Finally, we assess the robustness of the findings by extending the model in different directions.</description><author>Amaldoss, Wilfred; He, Chuan</author><pubDate>Sat, 01 Sep 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Optimal Contract to Induce Continued Effort</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Sun, Peng; Tian, Feng
We consider a basic model of a risk-neutral principal incentivizing a risk-neutral agent to exert effort to raise the arrival rate of a Poisson process. The effort is costly to the agent, is unobservable to the principal, and affects the instantaneous arrival rate. Each arrival yields a constant revenue to the principal. The principal, therefore, devises a mechanism involving payments and a potential stopping time to motivate the agent to always exert effort. We formulate this problem as a stochastic optimal control model with an incentive constraint in continuous time over an infinite horizon. Although we allow payments to take general forms contingent on past arrival times, the optimal contract has a simple and intuitive structure, which depends on whether the agent is as patient as or less patient than the principal toward future income.</description><author>Sun, Peng; Tian, Feng</author><pubDate>Sat, 01 Sep 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Price to Compete ... with Many: How to Identify Price Competition in High-Dimensional Space</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Li, Jun; Netessine, Serguei; Koulayev, Sergei
We study price competition in markets with a large number (in the magnitude of hundreds or thousands) of potential competitors. We address two methodological challenges: simultaneity bias and high dimensionality. Simultaneity bias arises from joint determination of prices in competitive markets. We propose a new instrumental variable approach to address simultaneity bias in high dimensions. The novelty of the idea is to exploit online search and clickstream data to uncover customer preferences at a granular level, with sufficient variations both over time and across competitors in order to obtain valid instruments at a large scale. We then develop a methodology to identify relevant competitors in high dimensions combining the instrumental variable approach with high-dimensional l - 1 norm regularization. We apply this data-driven approach to study the patterns of hotel price competition in the New York City market. We also show that the competitive responses identified through our method can help hoteliers proactively manage their prices and promotions.</description><author>Li, Jun; Netessine, Serguei; Koulayev, Sergei</author><pubDate>Sat, 01 Sep 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>The Effects of Hedge Fund Interventions on Strategic Firm Behavior</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Khurana, Inder K.; Li, Yinghua; Wang, Wei
We examine the impact of hedge fund interventions on target firms' strategic behavior, specifically their voluntary disclosure and earnings management strategies. We find a decrease in both the likelihood and the frequency of management earnings forecasts conveying bad news and an increase in the level of real earnings management following interventions by hedge fund activists. Additional evidence suggests that managers substitute between voluntary disclosure and earnings management strategies in resisting hedge fund attacks. We also find that withholding of bad news is more pronounced when hedge fund activists pose greater threats to the target firm's management and when the intervention lasts for a relatively short time period. Our results are consistent with firms behaving strategically in response to heightened career/reputation concerns and endangered corporate control arising from hedge fund activism.</description><author>Khurana, Inder K.; Li, Yinghua; Wang, Wei</author><pubDate>Sat, 01 Sep 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Firm Expansion, Size Spillovers, and Market Dominance in Retail Chain Dynamics</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Blevins, Jason R.; Khwaja, Ahmed; Yang, Nathan
We develop and estimate a dynamic game of strategic firm expansion and contraction decisions to study the role of firm size in future profitability and market dominance. Modeling firm size is important because retail chain dynamics are more richly driven by expansion and contraction than de novo entry or permanent exit. Additionally, anticipated size spillovers may influence the strategies of forward-looking firms, making it difficult to analyze the effects of size without explicitly accounting for these in the expectations and, hence, decisions of firms. Expansion may also be profitable for some firms while detrimental for others. Thus, we explicitly model and allow for heterogeneity in the dynamic link between firm size and profits as well as potential for persistent brand effects through firm-specific unobservable factors. As a methodological contribution, we surmount the hurdle of estimating the model by extending a two-step procedure that circumvents solving the game. The first stage combines semiparametric conditional choice probability estimation with a particle filter to eliminate the serially correlated unobservable components. The second stage uses a forward simulation approach to estimate the payoff parameters. Data on Canadian hamburger chains from their inception in 1970 to 2005 provide evidence of firm-specific heterogeneity in brand effects, size spillovers, and persistence in profitability. This heterogeneous dynamic linkage shows how McDonald's becomes dominant and other chains falter as they evolve, thus affecting market structure and industry concentration.</description><author>Blevins, Jason R.; Khwaja, Ahmed; Yang, Nathan</author><pubDate>Sat, 01 Sep 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Coordinated Logistics with a Truck and a Drone</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Carlsson, John Gunnar; Song, Siyuan
We determine the efficiency of a delivery system in which an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) provides service to customers while making return trips to a truck that is itself moving. In other words, a UAV picks up a package from the truck (which continues on its route), and after delivering the package, the UAV returns to the truck to pick up the next package. Although the hardware for such systems already exists, the extent to which such an approach can actually provide a significantly improved quality of service is not yet understood. By combining a theoretical analysis in the Euclidean plane with real-time numerical simulations on a road network, we demonstrate that the improvement in efficiency is proportional to the square root of the ratio of the speeds of the truck and the UAV.</description><author>Carlsson, John Gunnar; Song, Siyuan</author><pubDate>Sat, 01 Sep 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Dispute Resolution or Escalation? The Strategic Gaming of Feedback Withdrawal Options in Online Markets</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Bolton, Gary; Greiner, Ben; Ockenfels, Axel
Many online markets encourage traders to make good after an unsatisfactory transaction by offering the opportunity to withdraw negative reputational feedback in a dispute resolution phase. Motivated by field evidence and guided by theoretical considerations, we use laboratory markets with two-sided moral hazard to show that this option, contrary to the intended purpose, produces an escalation of dispute. The mutual feedback withdrawal option creates an incentive to leave negative feedback, independent of the opponent's behavior, to improve one's bargaining position in the dispute resolution phase. This leads to distorted reputation information and less trust and trustworthiness in the trading phase. Buyers who refuse to give feedback strategically, even when it comes at a personal cost, mitigate the detrimental impact. It is also mitigated in markets with one-sided moral hazard and a unilateral feedback withdrawal option.</description><author>Bolton, Gary; Greiner, Ben; Ockenfels, Axel</author><pubDate>Sat, 01 Sep 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Can Trustworthiness in a Supply Chain Be Signaled?</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Beer, Ruth; Ahn, Hyun-Soo; Leider, Stephen
The relationship between a buyer and its suppliers often relies on factors beyond the terms of a contractual agreement. Buyers can therefore benefit from identifying trustworthy suppliers. We argue that precontractual actions by a supplier, for example making costly buyer-specific investments without a long-term contract, can signal a supplier's trustworthiness. We develop a theoretical model to reflect supplier trustworthiness, and determine when a buyer can benefit from identifying trustworthy suppliers. We show that costly relationship-specific investments can serve as a signal of trustworthiness, and that supply chain profits increase when trustworthy suppliers are able to identify themselves in this fashion. We demonstrate the importance of the signaling mechanism using laboratory experiments. The experimental results show that relationship-specific investments lead to more collaborative transactions, with buyers offering higher prices and suppliers returning higher-quality products. This results in increased profits for both buyers and suppliers. Additionally, we design a treatment which shuts down the signaling mechanism and show that the benefits of the buyer-specific investment are no longer present in this case. Finally, we showthat the benefits of buyer-specific investments for both suppliers and buyers are strengthened when firms interact repeatedly.</description><author>Beer, Ruth; Ahn, Hyun-Soo; Leider, Stephen</author><pubDate>Sat, 01 Sep 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Shifting Blame? Experimental Evidence of Delegating Communication</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Garofalo, Orsola; Rott, Christina
Decision makers frequently have a spokesperson communicate their decisions. In this paper, we address two questions. First, does it matter who communicates an unfair decision? Second, does it matter how the unfair decision is communicated? We conduct a modified dictator game experiment in which either the decision maker or a spokesperson communicates the decided allocation to recipients, who then determine whether to punish either of them. We find that receivers punish both the decision maker and the spokesperson more often, and more heavily, for unfair allocations communicated by the spokesperson if there is room for shifting blame. The increased punishment results from the messenger's style of delivery: spokespersons are more likely than decision makers to express emotional regret instead of rational need. Receivers seem to punish the former style of communication because they view it as an attempt to shift blame. Our results establish more generally that the design of communication schemes shapes relationships among organizational members.</description><author>Garofalo, Orsola; Rott, Christina</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Aug 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Risk Aversion and Son Preference: Experimental Evidence from Chinese Twin Parents</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Chew, Soo Hong; Yi, Junjian; Zhang, Junsen; Zhong, Songfa
We study the role of risk aversion underlying son preference in patriarchal societies, where sons serve as better insurance for old-age support than daughters. The implications of an insurance motive on son preference are twofold. First, prior to the birth of their children, more-risk-averse parents have a stronger preference for sons than for daughters. Second, after the birth of their children, parents with sons are more risk seeking, compared to parents with daughters. We adopt a within-twin-pair fixed-effects estimator with a weak identification assumption, which enables us to jointly identify these two effects. We further conduct an incentivized choice experiment to assess parental risk attitude in a sample of Chinese twins with children, and follow up with a second twin sample to examine the replicability of the findings. In both samples, we find that parents with higher risk aversion before the birth of their children are more likely to have sons through sex selection than parents with lower risk aversion. Additionally, having sons significantly decreases parental risk aversion. These results contribute to the literature on the sources of son preference and help shed light on the nature of gender inequality.</description><author>Chew, Soo Hong; Yi, Junjian; Zhang, Junsen; Zhong, Songfa</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Aug 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Valuing Thinly Traded Assets</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Longstaff, Francis A.
We model illiquidity as a restriction on the stopping rules investors can follow in selling assets, and apply this framework to the valuation of thinly traded investments. We find that discounts for illiquidity can be surprisingly large, approaching 30%-50% in some cases. Immediacy plays a unique role and is valued much more than ongoing liquidity. We show that investors in illiquid enterprises have strong incentives to increase dividends and other cash payouts, thereby introducing potential agency conflicts. We also find that illiquidity and volatility are fundamentally entangled in their effects on asset prices. This aspect may help explain why some assets are viewed as inherently more liquid than others and why liquidity concerns are heightened during financial crises.</description><author>Longstaff, Francis A.</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Aug 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Foreigners vs. Natives: Bank Lending Technologies and Loan Pricing</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Beck, Thorsten; Ioannidou, Vasso V.; Schaefer, Larissa
Can distance-related information asymmetries in credit markets be overcome with contract design and credit scoring models? To answer this question, we explore differences in foreign and domestic banks' credit contract terms and pricing models. Using a sample of firms that borrow from both domestic and foreign banks in the same month, we show that foreign banks are more likely to demand collateral and grant shorter maturity loans than domestic banks. Foreign banks also base their pricing on internal credit ratings and collateral pledges, while domestic banks price according to the length, depth, and breadth of their relationship with a firm. These findings confirm that foreign banks can overcome informational disadvantages using contract design and credit scoring models. However, we also show that there are limitations, with foreign banks facing higher default rates and lower returns on lending if not using collateral and short maturity as disciplining tools.</description><author>Beck, Thorsten; Ioannidou, Vasso V.; Schaefer, Larissa</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Aug 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Do Superstitious Traders Lose Money?</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Bhattacharya, Utpal; Kuo, Wei-Yu; Lin, Tse-Chun; Zhao, Jing
Do superstitious traders lose money? We answer this question in the context of trading in the Taiwan Futures Exchange, where we exploit the Chinese superstition that the number 8 is lucky and the number 4 is unlucky. We find that individual investors, but not institutional investors, submit disproportionately more limit orders at 8 than at 4. This imbalance, defined as the "superstition index" for each investor, is positively correlated with trading losses. Superstitious investors lose money mainly because of their bad market timing and stale orders. Nevertheless, the reliance on number superstition for limit order submissions does decrease with trading experience.</description><author>Bhattacharya, Utpal; Kuo, Wei-Yu; Lin, Tse-Chun; Zhao, Jing</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Aug 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Marking to Market and Inefficient Investment Decisions</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Otto, Clemens A.; Volpin, Paolo F.
We examine how mark-to-market accounting affects the investment decisions of managers with reputation concerns. Reporting the current market value of a firm's assets can help mitigate agency problems because it provides outsiders (e.g., shareholders) with new information against which the management's decisions can be evaluated. However, the fact that the assets' market value is informative can also have a negative side effect: managers may shy away from investments that indicate conflicting private information and would damage their reputation. This effect can lead to inefficient investment decisions and make marking to market less desirable when market prices are more informative.</description><author>Otto, Clemens A.; Volpin, Paolo F.</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Aug 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Conglomerate Industry Choice and Product Language</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Hoberg, Gerard; Phillips, Gordon
We analyze the words that firms use to describe their products so we can examine the determinants of which industries conglomerate firms operate within. Our central finding is that multiple-industry firms operate across industries with higher product language overlap. Multiple-industry firms also avoid industries with more distinct language boundaries and those with more specialized within-industry language. We also find evidence linking these results to specific synergies such as potential entry into new markets and realized synergies in the form of higher 10-K product description growth. These findings are consistent with multiple-product firms operating primarily in industries that lack language specialization. Our findings show that most conglomerates are not true diversified conglomerates with little overlap in their lines of business, as most firms that operate across multiple industries choose industries with high language overlap and potential synergies. Our results support theories of firm organization and organizational language.</description><author>Hoberg, Gerard; Phillips, Gordon</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Aug 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>The Competitive Dynamics of New DVD Releases</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Mukherjee, Anirban; Kadiyali, Vrinda
We study the market for new (movie) DVDs in the United States. Our demand model captures seasonality, freshness (i.e., time between theatrical and DVD release), and state dependence. We also develop a structural model of dynamic competition in which studios balance waiting for high-demand weeks, against reduced freshness, and against competitive crowding. We find that studios emphasize DVD revenues from larger movies (by theatrical revenue) over DVD revenues from smaller movies. Studios also emphasize revenue from consumers who prefer larger and fresher movies. These behaviors are consistent with managerial conservatism: studio executives forgo DVD revenues from smaller movies to ensure the DVD success of larger movies.</description><author>Mukherjee, Anirban; Kadiyali, Vrinda</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Aug 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Super Partes?

Incumbents can enjoy a cost advantage vis-a-vis new entrants and so deter new firm entry by establishing and leveraging connections with the judicial system. Connected firms may in fact avoid fully complying with the costly norms implied by a law, a regulation, or a contract. At the same time, they can also credibly threaten to sue new entrants. Therefore, a change in the institutional environment that diminishes the ability of incumbent firms to establish judicial connections-i.e., an increase in judicial independence-can promote entrepreneurship. Exploiting reforms that change the way in which U.S. state judges are selected, we confirm that this is the case, and we show that this effect is more salient in states and industries where the likelihood of entering into a business dispute is higher. The paper also sheds some light on the mechanisms behind this effect.</description><author>Conti, Raffaele; Valentini, Giovanni</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Aug 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Pricing When Customers Have Limited Attention</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Boyaci, Tamer; Akcay, Yalcin
We study the optimal pricing problem of a monopolistic firm facing customers with limited attention and capability to process information about the value (quality) of a single offered product. We model customer choice based on the theory of rational inattention in the economics literature, which enables us to capture not only the impact of true quality and price, but also the intricate effects of customer's prior beliefs and cost of information acquisition and processing. We formulate the firm's price optimization problem assuming that the firm can also use the price to signal the quality of the product to customers. To delineate the economic incentives of the firm, we first characterize the pricing and revenue implications of customer's limited attention without signaling, and then use these results to explore perfect Bayesian equilibria of the strategic pricing signaling game. As an extension, we consider heterogeneous customers with different information costs as well as prior beliefs. We discuss the managerial implications of our key findings and prescribe insights regarding information provision and product positioning.</description><author>Boyaci, Tamer; Akcay, Yalcin</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jul 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Temporary incentives Change Daily Routines: Evidence from a Field Experiment on Singapore's Subways</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Yang, Nan; Lim, Yong Long
We show that temporary incentives can lead to lasting changes in people's daily routines through a field experiment. In randomized controlled trials on Singapore's subways, commuters in the treatment group received a full rebate of their fares for 10 weeks if they exited fare gates before the start of morning peak-travel time. The objective of the fare promotion was to alleviate peak-time congestion by encouraging commuters to travel prepeak. This promotion resembles an actual public program implemented in Singapore in 2013. Using participants' fare cards, we obtained a rich data set for 60 weeks' worth of trips. A difference-in-differences analysis reveals that the effect of the free-trip offer was modest but robust during the promotional period: on average, trips were 5.5% more likely to end before the morning peak time. More encouragingly, the modest shift toward early travel strongly persisted even seven months after the end of the free-trip offer. This seemingly small shift could imply large financial savings on infrastructure investment. We find suggestive evidence that travel regularity and consistency during the promotion appear to be important for forging persistence.</description><author>Yang, Nan; Lim, Yong Long</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jul 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Predictably Angry-Facial Cues Provide a Credible Signal of Destructive Behavior</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>van Leeuwen, Boris; Noussair, Charles N.; Offerman, Theo; Suetens, Sigrid; van Veelen, Matthijs; van de Ven, Jeroen
Evolutionary explanations of anger as a commitment device hinge on two key assumptions. The first is that it is predictable, ex ante, whether someone will get angry when feeling that he or she has been badly treated. The second is that anger is associated with destructive behavior. We test the validity of these two assumptions. We collected photos of responders in an ultimatum game before they were informed about the game that they would be playing, and we filmed responders with webcams during play. We then showed pairs of photos consisting of one responder who rejected and one responder who accepted (a low offer) to an independent group of observers. We find that observers are better than chance at detecting who rejected the low offer; they do 10% better than random guessing would. We also find that anger at receiving a low offer is associated with rejection.</description><author>van Leeuwen, Boris; Noussair, Charles N.; Offerman, Theo; Suetens, Sigrid; van Veelen, Matthijs; van de Ven, Jeroen</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jul 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>The Colorblind Crowd?

The dearth of minority entrepreneurs has received increasing media attention but few academic analyses. In particular, the funding process creates challenges for either audit or correspondence methods, making it difficult to assess the role, or type, of discrimination influencing resource providers. We use a novel approach that combines analyses of 7,617 crowdfunding projects with an experimental design to identify whether African American men are discriminated against and whether this reflects statistical, taste-based, or unconscious bias on the part of prospective supporters. We find that African American men are significantly less likely than similar white founders to receive funding and that prospective supporters rate identical projects as lower in quality when they believe the founder is an African American male. We conclude that the reduction in perceived quality does not reflect conscious assumptions of differences in founder ability or disamenity but rather an unconscious assumption that black founders are lower quality. In two additional experiments, we identify three means of reducing this bias: through additional evidence of quality via third-party endorsements (i.e., awards, evidence of prior support), through evidence that African American founders have succeeded previously, and by removing indicators of the founder's race.</description><author>Younkin, Peter; Kuppuswamy, Venkat</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jul 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Pricing of Conditional Upgrades in the Presence of Strategic Consumers</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Cui, Yao; Duenyas, Izak; Sahin, Ozge
In this paper, we study a conditional upgrade strategy that has recently emerged in the travel industry. After a consumer makes a reservation for a product (e.g., a hotel room), she is asked whether she would like to upgrade her product to a higher-quality (more expensive) one at a discounted price. The upgrade, however, is not fulfilled immediately. The firm fulfills upgrades at check-in if higher-quality products are still available, and the upgrade fee is charged to the consumer if and only if she actually gets upgraded. Consumers decide which product type to book and whether to accept an upgrade offer or not based on the anticipated upgrade probability. We find that conditional upgrades create value by improving demand-supply matching for the firm. The firm can use the conditional upgrade channel to flexibly manage capacity allocations and reoptimize demand segmentation. For a firm that takes product prices as given, offering conditional upgrades is effective in compensating for the firm's lack of ability in setting prices optimally. For a firm that has the ability to optimize product prices, conditional upgrades generate higher revenues than dynamic pricing.</description><author>Cui, Yao; Duenyas, Izak; Sahin, Ozge</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jul 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Are All Spillovers Created Equal?

This study examines how characteristics of an interfirm labor-flow network affect firm productivity. Using employee job histories to trace labor movement between organizations, we construct labor-flow networks for both information technology (IT) and non-IT labor and analyze how a firm's network structure for the two types of labor affects its performance. We find that hiring IT workers from a structurally diverse network of firms can substantially improve firm productivity, but that the same is not true for non-IT labor, where we find little benefit of network diversity. We hypothesize that these results reflect differences in the types of knowledge diffusion facilitated by different types of labor flows, with IT labor enabling the transfer of new and innovative firm practices, which benefits from diversity, while non-IT labor flows are more closely associated with implementation of complementary organizational practices, which may benefit from a critical mass of workers with a common knowledge base. Together, these results demonstrate the importance of incorporating a network perspective in understanding the full impact of spillover effects from organizational hiring activities.</description><author>Wu, Lynn; Jin, Fujie; Hitt, Lorin M.</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jul 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Asymmetry and Ambiguity in Newsvendor Models</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Natarajan, Karthik; Sim, Melvyn; Uichanco, Joline
A basic assumption of the classical newsvendor model is that the probability distribution of the random demand is known. But in most realistic settings, only partial distribution information is available or reliably estimated. The distributionally robust newsvendor model is often used in this case where the worst-case expected profit is maximized over the set of distributions satisfying the known information, which is usually the mean and covariance of demands. However, covariance does not capture information on asymmetry of the demand distribution. In this paper, we introduce a measure of distribution asymmetry using second-order partitioned statistics. Semivariance is a special case with a single partition of the univariate demand. With mean, variance, and semivariance information, we show that a three-point distribution achieves the worst-case expected profit and derive a closed-form expression for the distributionally robust order quantity. For multivariate demand, the distributionally robust problem with partitioned statistics is hard to solve, but we develop a computationally tractable lower bound through the solution of a semidefinite program. We demonstrate in numerical experiments that asymmetry information significantly reduces expected profit loss particularly when the true distribution is heavy tailed. In computational experiments on automotive spare parts demand data, we provide evidence that the distributionally robust model that includes partitioned statistics outperforms the model that uses only covariance information.</description><author>Natarajan, Karthik; Sim, Melvyn; Uichanco, Joline</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jul 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>The Value of "Bespoke": Demand Learning, Preference Learning, and Customer Behavior</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Huang, Tingliang; Liang, Chao; Wang, Jingqi
"Bespoke," or mass customization strategy, combines demand learning and preference learning. We develop an analytical framework to study the economic value of bespoke systems and investigate the interaction between demand learning and preference learning. We find that it is possible for demand learning and preference learning to be either complements or substitutes, depending on the customization cost and the demand uncertainty profile. They are generally complements when the personalization cost is low and the probability of having high demand is large. Contrary to usual belief, we show that higher demand uncertainty does not necessarily yield more complementarity benefits. Our numerical study shows that the complementarity benefit becomes weaker when customers are more strategic. Interestingly, the substitute loss can occur when the personalization cost is small and the probability of having high demand is large, when customers are strategic.</description><author>Huang, Tingliang; Liang, Chao; Wang, Jingqi</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jul 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Competitive Strategies for Brick-and-Mortar Stores to Counter "Showrooming"</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Mehra, Amit; Kumar, Subodha; Raju, Jagmohan S.
Customers often evaluate products at brick-and-mortar stores to identify their "best-fit" product but buy it for a lower price at a competing online retailer. This free-riding behavior by customers is referred to as "showrooming," and we show that this is detrimental to the profits of the brick-and-mortar stores. We first analyze price matching as a short-term strategy to counter showrooming. Price matching allows customers to purchase a product from the store for less than the store's posted price, so one would expect the price matching strategy to be less effective as the fraction of customers who seek the matching increases. However, our results show that with an increase in the fraction of customers who seek price matching, the store's profits initially decrease and then increase. While price matching could be used even when customers do not exhibit showrooming behavior, we find that it is more effective when customers do showrooming. We then study exclusivity of product assortments as a long-term strategy to counter showrooming. This strategy can be implemented in two different ways: (1) by arranging for exclusivity of known brands (e.g., Macy's has such an arrangement with Tommy Hilfiger) or (2) through the creation of store brands at the brick-and-mortar store (T. J. Maxx sells a large number of store brands). Our analysis suggests that implementing exclusivity through store brands is better than exclusivity through known brands when the product category has few digital attributes. However, when customers do not showroom, the known-brand strategy dominates the store-brand strategy.</description><author>Mehra, Amit; Kumar, Subodha; Raju, Jagmohan S.</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jul 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Innovation, Openness, and Platform Control</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Parker, Geoffrey; Van Alstyne, Marshall
Suppose that a firm in charge of a business ecosystem is a firm in charge of a microeconomy. To achieve the highest growth rate, how open should that economy be? To encourage third-party developers, how long should their intellectual property interests last? We develop a sequential innovation model that addresses the trade-offs inherent in these two decisions: (i) Closing the platform increases the sponsor's ability to charge for access, while opening the platform increases developer ability to build upon it. (ii) The longer third-party developers retain rights to their innovations, the higher the royalties they and the sponsor earn, but the sooner those developers' rights expire, the sooner their innovations become a public good upon which other developers can build. Our model allows us to characterize the optimal levels of openness and of intellectual property (IP) duration in a platform ecosystem. We use standard Cobb-Douglas production technologies to derive our results. These findings can inform innovation strategy, choice of organizational form, IP noncompete decisions, and regulation policy.</description><author>Parker, Geoffrey; Van Alstyne, Marshall</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jul 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Competing by Restricting Choice: The Case of Matching Platforms</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Halaburda, Hanna; Piskorski, Mikolaj Jan; Yildirim, Pinar
We show that a two-sided matching platform can successfully compete by limiting the number of choices it offers to its customers, while charging higher prices than platforms with unrestricted choice. We develop a stylized model of online dating where agents with different outside options match based on how much they like each other. Starting from these microfoundations, we derive the strength and direction of indirect network effects and show that increasing the number of potential matches has a positive effect due to larger choice, but also a negative effect due to competition between agents on the same side. Agents resolve the trade-off between these competing effects differently, depending on their outside options. For agents with high outside options, the choice effect is stronger than the competition effect, leading them to prefer an unrestricted-choice platform. The opposite is the case for agents with low outside options, who then have higher willingness to pay for a platform restricting choice, as it also restricts the choice set of their potential matches. Moreover, since only agents with low outside options self-select into the restricted choice platform, the competition effect is mitigated further. This allows multiple platforms offering different number of choices to coexist without the market tipping.</description><author>Halaburda, Hanna; Piskorski, Mikolaj Jan; Yildirim, Pinar</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Aug 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>The Informational Role of Corporate Hedging</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Manconi, Alberto; Massa, Massimo; Zhang, Lei
We study the informational role of corporate hedging, comparing two hypotheses.

Under the "transparency" hypothesis, hedging reduces uncertainty and erodes the informed traders' information advantage and profitability. Our tests support the transparency hypothesis. Hedging is associated with lower uncertainty (lower implied volatility and analyst forecast dispersion, and greater breadth of ownership). It is also associated with a lower informed trading intensity, in particular for short selling. Short selling profits are more than twice lower on the stocks of firms engaging in corporate hedging.</description><author>Manconi, Alberto; Massa, Massimo; Zhang, Lei</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Aug 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Do Stock Returns Really Decrease with Default Risk?

Using the reduced-form approach of Campbell et al.

This finding is robust to different portfolio weighting schemes, data filters, risk-adjusting approaches, and holding period definitions. Decomposing the default risk measure into its systematic and idiosyncratic components, we find that the former drives this positive relation. We also show that the default risk premium is more pronounced in countries where creditor protection is stronger and shareholder bargaining power is lower.</description><author>Aretz, Kevin; Florackis, Chris; Kostakis, Alexandros</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Aug 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Initiative, Incentives, and Soft Information</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Liberti, Jose Maria

We consider a firm where the sales division (SALES) is responsible for demand forecasting and the operations division (OPERATIONS) is responsible for ordering. SALES has better information about the demand than OPERATIONS and sends a nonbinding demand forecast to OPERATIONS. To incentivize truthful information sharing, we include a forecast error penalty in the incentive system of SALES. Besides monetary payoffs, we also add behavioral factors to the utility function of SALES. We model the setting as a signaling game and derive the Pareto-dominant separating equilibria of the game. In laboratory experiments, we observe human behavior that is in line with the predictions of the behavioral model but deviates substantially from expected-payoff-maximizing behavior. We use the behavioral model to design incentive systems for truthful information sharing and validate the approach in an experiment with out-of-sample treatments and out-of-sample subjects. We conduct additional experiments to provide further robustness to the results.</description><author>Scheele, Lisa M.; Thonemann, Ulrich W.; Slikker, Marco</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Aug 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Trade Credit, Risk Sharing, and Inventory Financing Portfolios</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Yang, S. Alex; Birge, John R.
As an integrated part of a supply contract, trade credit has intrinsic connections with supply chain coordination and inventory management. Using a model that explicitly captures the interaction of firms' operations decisions, financial constraints, and multiple financing channels (bank loans and trade credit), this paper attempts to better understand the risk-sharing role of trade credit-that is, how trade credit enhances supply chain efficiency by allowing the retailer to partially share the demand risk with the supplier. Within this role, in equilibrium, trade credit is an indispensable external source for inventory financing, even when the supplier is at a disadvantageous position in managing default relative to a bank. Specifically, the equilibrium trade credit contract is net terms when the retailer's financial status is relatively strong. Accordingly, trade credit is the only external source that the retailer uses to finance inventory. By contrast, if the retailer's cash level is low, the supplier offers two-part terms, inducing the retailer to finance inventory with a portfolio of trade credit and bank loans. Further, a deeper early-payment discount is offered when the supplier is relatively less efficient in recovering defaulted trade credit, or the retailer has stronger market power. Trade credit allows the supplier to take advantage of the retailer's financial weakness, yet it may also benefit both parties when the retailer's cash is reasonably high. Finally, using a sample of firm-level data on retailers, we empirically observe the inventory financing pattern that is consistent with what our model predicts.</description><author>Yang, S.

Consumers search for product information to resolve valuation uncertainties before purchase. We incorporate search cost into consumer choice models and study the two-stage consider then choose policy. In the first stage, a consumer forms her consideration set by balancing utility uncertainty and search cost. In the second stage, she evaluates all products in her consideration set and chooses the one with the highest net utility. We show that the revenue-ordered assortment (i.e., the offer set that includes products in the revenue-decreasing order) fails to be optimal, although it can obtain at least half the optimal revenue. We propose a k-quasi-attractiveness-ordered assortment and show that it can be arbitrarily near optimal for the market share maximization problem. The assortment problems with search cost are generally NP-hard, so we develop efficient approximation or relatively fast exact algorithms for a variety of assortment problems under the consider-then-choose models with search cost. For the joint assortment planning and pricing problem with homogeneous consumers, we show that the intrinsic-utility-ordered assortment and the quasi-same-price policy, which charges the same price for all products except at most one, are optimal.</description><author>Wang, Ruxian; Sahin, Ozge</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Aug 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Understanding Team Knowledge Production: The Interrelated Roles of Technology and Expertise</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Teodoridis, Florenta

I examine the hack of Microsoft Kinect as an exogenous event that suddenly reduced motion-sensing technology costs. I show that great reductions in technology costs substitute for ex ante optimal involvement of area specialists and facilitate involvement of outside-area specialists through collaboration with researchers with broader knowledge- generalists. In other words, technology costs influence the composition of expertise in teamwork, with sufficiently large reductions leading to knowledge creation that combines more broadly across knowledge areas. These findings have important implications for organizations and policy makers in crafting incentives for more diverse knowledge creation through strategic investments that lower technology costs and influence team formation.</description><author>Teodoridis, Florenta</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Aug 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Output Decisions and Price Matching: Theory and Experiment</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Batsaikhan, Mongoljin; Tumennasan, Norovsambuu
We study the effects of price matching in a setting in which each firm selects both its price and output, simultaneously. We show that the availability of a price-matching option leads to the Cournot outcome in this setting. Our experimental study confirms this result in the laboratory. Our finding is a stark contrast to the one obtained in the standard price competition that the most likely market price in the presence of a price-matching option is the monopolistic price. In addition, we show that price matching benefits consumers in markets with a large number of firms. If a market has a few firms, then the effects of price matching on consumers depend on the market demand and cost functions. Thus, our study suggests that the effect of price matching depends on the strategic variables of the firms.</description><author>Batsaikhan, Mongoljin; Tumennasan, Norovsambuu</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Aug 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Omnichannel Service Operations with Online and Offline Self-Order Technologies</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Gao, Fei; Su, Xuanming
Many restaurants have recently implemented self-order technologies across both online and offline channels. Online technology, through websites and mobile apps, allows customers to order and pay before coming to the store; offline technology, such as self-service kiosks, allows store customers to place orders without interacting with a human employee. In this paper, we develop a stylized theoretical model to study the impact of self-order technologies on customer demand, employment levels, and restaurant profits. Our main results follow. First, customers using self-order technologies experience reduced waiting cost and increased demand, and moreover, these benefits may even carry over to customers who do not use these technologies. Second, although public opinion suggests that self-order technologies facilitate job cuts, we find instead that some firms should increase employment levels, and, paradoxically, this recommendation holds for firms with high labor costs. Finally, we find that firms should implement online (offline) self-order technology when customers have high (low) wait sensitivity.</description><author>Gao, Fei; Su, Xuanming</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Aug 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Capacity Sharing Between Competitors</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Guo, Liang; Wu, Xiaole
Market competition may lead to mismatch between supply and demand. That is, overpricing may give rise to underselling, and underpricing may yield stockout. Capacity sharing is a common practice to align excessive capacity with excessive demand. Yet, the strategic interaction between competition and capacity sharing has not been adequately addressed. In this paper, we investigate optimal strategies and firm profitability of capacity sharing between competing firms under both ex ante and ex post contracting, depending on whether the capacity-sharing price is determined before or after price setting in the buyer market. We show that, with symmetric capacity, committing to an overly high capacity-sharing price may not necessarily improve firm payoffs. Capacity sharing softens price competition under either contracting scheme, whereas the optimal capacity-transfer price and equilibrium profits may be nonmonotonically influenced by buyer loyalty. The equilibrium outcome under ex ante contracting is more sensitive to variations in market parameters than ex post contracting. As a result, ex ante contracting is more likely to be preferred when the endowed capacity is low or buyer loyalty is high. However, when firms' capacity is asymmetric, capacity sharing may intensify equilibrium competition and hurt firm profitability through reversing the firms' relative pricing aggressiveness.</description><author>Guo, Liang; Wu, Xiaole</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Aug 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>To Be or Not to Be Linked: Online social Networks and Job Search by Unemployed Workforce</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Garg, Rajiv; Telang, Rahul
Prior research suggests that social connections, including acquaintances, friends, and family, are valuable in a job search process. In these studies, the size of an average job seeker's network was much smaller and limited by the available modes of communication and the costs associated with maintaining social connections. However, the recent growth of online social networks has enabled job seekers to stay connected with many connections, weak or strong. Thus, the number of online connections-especially weak-has increased significantly. In this paper, we first examine whether an individual's social network plays a role in driving job search behavior, taking into account online social networking sites (e.g., Linkedln) and other job search modes. Second, we examine how ties in online social networks (both weak and strong) affect job search outcomes (modeled sequentially as job leads, interviews, and offers), and we compare the findings to job outcomes from traditional job search modes (e.g., career fairs, newspaper, Internet postings, and friends and family). To do so, we first construct an economic model of search behavior incorporating cost and benefit functions; we then estimate the model to recover structural parameters using the survey data of 424 users. Our findings show that users are spending more time searching for jobs on social networking sites. In addition, users' strong ties play a significant role in job search and are especially helpful in generating job leads, interviews, and offers; the weak ties, on average, are ineffective in generating positive outcomes and marginally negative in some cases.</description><author>Garg, Rajiv; Telang, Rahul</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Aug 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Gender Quotas, Competitions, and Peer Review: Experimental Evidence on the Backlash Against Women</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Leibbrandt, Andreas; Wang, Liang Choon; Foo, Cordelia
This study experimentally investigates gender quotas in light of peer review. We investigate competitions with and without gender quotas and a peer review process that allows for sabotage. Our findings show that the possibility of peer sabotage renders the gender quota ineffective in encouraging women to enter tournaments. Moreover, we provide evidence of a severe backlash against women, as they become targets of sabotage under gender quotas. Interestingly, this is the result of women focusing on sabotaging each other while men sabotage indiscriminately.

This paper investigates the effect of work interruption on workers' subsequent productivity. We employ a data set of individual productivity and machine conditions, in which each worker faces the chance, on a daily basis, that her machine will break down randomly. Our analysis finds that compared to a workday with smooth production, experiencing a machine breakdown is associated with a 3.3 percentage point decline in the worker's productivity the following day. We discuss possible explanations for the observed effect, including negative emotions, increased cautiousness in operating the machine, and proficiency loss.

Currently available medication for treating many chronic diseases is often effective only for a subgroup of patients, and biomarkers accurately assessing whether an individual belongs to this subgroup typically do not exist. In such settings, physicians learn about the effectiveness of a drug primarily through experimentation-i.e., by initiating treatment and monitoring the patient's response. Precise guidelines for discontinuing treatment are often lacking or left entirely to the physician's discretion. We introduce a framework for developing adaptive, personalized treatments for such chronic diseases. Our model is based on a continuous-time, multi-armed bandit setting where drug effectiveness is assessed by aggregating information from several channels: by continuously monitoring the state of the patient, but also by (not) observing the occurrence of particular infrequent health events, such as relapses or disease flare-ups. Recognizing that the timing and severity of such events provide critical information for treatment decisions is a key point of departure in our framework compared with typical (bandit) models used in healthcare. We show that the model can be analyzed in closed form for several settings of interest, resulting in optimal policies that are intuitive and may have practical appeal. We illustrate the effectiveness of the methodology by developing a set of efficient treatment policies for multiple sclerosis, which we then use to benchmark several existing treatment guidelines.</description><author>Negoescu, Diana M.; Bimpikis, Kostas; Brandeau, Margaret L.; Iancu, Dan A.</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Aug 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Searching for Structure: Formal Organization Design as a Guide to Network Evolution</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Clement, Julien; Puranam, Phanish
Is top-down organization design worth attempting at all, or should organizations simply let their members learn which patterns of interaction are valuable by themselves, through a bottom-up process? Our analysis of an agent-based computational model shows that weak enforcement of even a randomly selected formal structure in a top-down manner can usefully guide the bottom-up emergence of networks of intraorganizational interactions between agents. In the absence of formal structure, interactions are prone to decline within organizations, because maintaining interactions requires coordination but breaking them does not. Formal structure regenerates the network of interactions between agents, who can then learn which interactions to keep or discard. This "network regeneration effect" of formal structure offers a rationale for the importance of top-down organization design, even if the design is limited in accuracy and enforcement.</description><author>Clement, Julien; Puranam, Phanish</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Aug 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Managing Customer Expectations and Priorities in Service Systems</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Yu, Qiuping; Allon, Gad; Bassamboo, Achal; Iravani, Seyed
We study how to use delay announcements to manage customer expectations while allowing a firm to prioritize among customers with different sensitivities to time and value. We examine this problem by developing a framework that characterizes the strategic interaction between the firm and heterogeneous customers. When the firm has information about the state of the system, yet lacks information on customer types, delay announcements play a dual role: they inform customers about the state of the system, while they also have the potential to elicit information on customer types based on their response to the announcements. The tension between these two goals has implications for the type of information that can be shared credibly. To explore the value of the information on customer types, we also study a model where the firm can observe customer types. We show that having information on the customer type may improve or hurt the credibility of the firm. While the creation of credibility increases the firm's profit, the loss of credibility does not necessarily hurt its profit.</description><author>Yu, Qiuping; Allon, Gad; Bassamboo, Achal; Iravani, Seyed</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Aug 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Uncertainty, Capital Investment, and Risk Management</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Doshi, Hitesh; Kumar, Praveen; Yerramilli, Vijay
We use forward-looking and exogenous measures of output price uncertainty to examine the effect of price uncertainty on firm-level capital investment, risk management, and debt issuance. The effects of uncertainty vary significantly by firm size. When faced with high price uncertainty, large firms increase their hedging intensity but do not lower capital investment or debt issuance. In contrast, small firms do not adjust their hedging intensity but significantly lower capital expenditure and debt issuance even after controlling for investment demand. Moreover, the negative effect of uncertainty on capital investment is significantly weaker for firms that hedge their output price risk. Our analysis highlights that, in the presence of financial frictions, high price uncertainty has significant dampening effects on capital investment of small firms by exacerbating their financial constraints, and that this negative effect is amplified by firm-level constraints on ability to hedge risk exposures.</description><author>Doshi, Hitesh; Kumar, Praveen; Yerramilli, Vijay</author><pubDate>Sat, 01 Dec 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>CEO Confidence and Unreported R&amp;D</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Koh, Ping-Sheng; Reeb, David M.; Zhao, Wanli

Exploiting staggered, state-level regulatory shocks and changes in CEO type, we find substantial evidence that cautious CEO firms fail to report R&amp;D expenditures. After a plausibly exogenous shock to managerial reporting liability, cautious CEO firms exhibit a 35% larger reduction in unreported R&amp;D relative to confident CEO firms. Interestingly, confident CEO firms do not exhibit more innovation than their cautious CEO counterparts after taking into account their differing propensities to report corporate R&amp;D.

Resource pooling strategies have been widely used in industry to match supply with demand. However, effective implementation of these strategies can be challenging. Firms need to integrate the heterogeneous service level requirements of different customers into the pooling model and allocate the resources (inventory or capacity) appropriately in the most effective manner. The traditional analysis of inventory pooling, for instance, considers the performance metric in a centralized system and does not address the associated issue of inventory allocation. Using Blackwell's Approachability Theorem, we derive a set of necessary and sufficient conditions to relate the fill rate requirement of each customer to the resources needed in the system. This provides a new approach to studying the value of resource pooling in a system with differentiated service requirements. Furthermore, we show that with "allocation flexibility," the amount of safety stock needed in a system with independent and identically distributed demands does not grow with the number of customers but instead diminishes to zero and eventually becomes negative as the number of customers grows sufficiently large. This surprising result holds for all demand distributions with bounded first and second moments.</description><author>Zhong, Yuanguang; Zheng, Zhichao; Chou, Mabel C.; Teo, Chung-Piaw</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Apr 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Incentives for Prosocial Behavior: The Role of Reputations</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Exley, Christine
Do monetary incentives encourage volunteering? Or, do they introduce concerns about appearing greedy and crowd out the motivation to volunteer? Since the importance of such image concerns is normally unobserved, the answer is theoretically unclear, and corresponding empirical evidence is mixed. To help counter this ambiguity, this paper proposes that the importance of image concerns-such as the desire to appear prosocial and not to appear greedy-relates to individuals' volunteer reputations. Experimental results support this possibility. Individuals with past histories of volunteering are less responsive to image concerns if their histories are public, or if their prosocial tendencies are already known. Consistent with a decreased importance of appearing prosocial, they are less likely to volunteer. Consistent with a decreased importance of not appearing greedy, they are less likely to be discouraged by public incentives.</description><author>Exley, Christine</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 May 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Translated Attributes as Choice Architecture: Aligning Objectives and Choices Through Decision Signposts</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Ungemach, Christoph; Camilleri, Adrian R.; Johnson, Eric J.; Larrick, Richard P.; Weber, Elke U.
Every attribute can be expressed in multiple ways. For example, car fuel economy can be expressed as fuel efficiency ("miles per gallon"), fuel cost in dollars, or tons of greenhouse gases emitted. Each expression, or "translation," highlights a different aspect of the same attribute. We describe a new mechanism whereby translated attributes can serve as decision "signposts" because they (1) activate otherwise dormant objectives, such as proenvironmental values and goals, and (2) direct the person toward the option that best achieves the activated objective. Across three experiments, we provide evidence for the occurrence of such signpost effects as well as the underlying psychological mechanism. We demonstrate that expressing an attribute such as fuel economy in terms of multiple translations can increase preference for the option that is better aligned with objectives congruent with this attribute (e.g., the more fuel-efficient car for those with proenvironmental attitudes), even when the new information is derivable from other known attributes. We discuss how using translated attributes appropriately can help align a person's choices with their personal objectives.</description><author>Ungemach, Christoph; Camilleri, Adrian R.; Johnson, Eric J.; Larrick, Richard P.; Weber, Elke U.</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 May 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Probability Forecasts Made at Multiple Lead Times</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Regnier, Eva

Although methods for evaluating probability forecasts have been extensively studied, they apply to a single forecast per event. This paper is the first to evaluate probability forecasts that are made-and therefore revised-at many lead times for a single event. I postulate a norm for multi-period probability-forecasting systems and derive properties that should hold regardless of the forecasting process. I use these properties to develop methods for evaluating a forecasting system based on a sample. I apply these methods to the National Hurricane Center's wind-speed probability forecasts and to statistical election forecasts, finding evidence that both can be improved using the current set of predictors.</description><author>Regnier, Eva</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 May 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Self-Regulation of an Unobservable Queue</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Haviv, Moshe; Oz, Binyamin
We consider an unobservable M/M/1 queue where customers are homogeneous with respect to service valuation and cost per unit time of waiting. It is well known that left to themselves, in equilibrium, customers join the queue at a rate higher than is socially optimal. Hence, regulation schemes, under which the resulting equilibrium joining rate coincides with the socially optimal one, should be considered. We suggest a classification of regulation schemes based on a few desired properties and use it to classify schemes from the existing literature. To the best of our knowledge, none of the existing schemes possesses all of the properties, and in this paper we suggest such a scheme. Its novelty is in assigning random priorities to customers, prior to their decision whether to join or balk. We also introduce variations of this regulation scheme as well as others that are also based on randomization.</description><author>Haviv, Moshe; Oz, Binyamin</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 May 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Choosing an n-Pack of Substitutable Products</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Fox, Edward; Norman, Laura; Semple, John
We develop a framework to model the shopping and consumption decisions of forward-looking consumers. Assuming that the consumer's future utility for each product alternative can be characterized by a standard random utility model, we use dynamic programming to determine the optimal consumption policy and the maximum expected value of consuming any n substitutable products selected while shopping (an n-pack). We propose two models. In the first (canonical) model, we assume that an alternative is consumed on each successive consumption occasion and obtain a closed-form optimal policy and a closed-form value function. Given a consumer's preferences for the product alternatives in an assortment, we then show how to identify that consumer's optimal n-pack using a simple swapping algorithm that converges in at most n swaps. In the second (generalized) model, we introduce an outside option so that a product alternative need not be consumed on each consumption occasion. We obtain a closed-form value function for the generalized model and show that its optimal n-pack is related to that of the canonical model using a special type of majorization. Additional structural properties and implications of each model are explored, as are other applications.</description><author>Fox, Edward; Norman, Laura; Semple, John</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 May 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>An Experimental Investigation of Managing Quality Through Monetary and Relational Incentives</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Davis, Andrew M.; Hyndman, Kyle
We investigate the efficacy of monetary and relational incentives for managing the quality of a product in a two-tier supply chain. In our setting, a retailer offers a supplier contract terms for a product, where the product can be low or high quality. The supplier can choose to exert high effort, which is costly but guarantees high quality, or low effort, which does not assure high quality with certainty. We compare how monetary incentives, such as a bonus that is paid to the supplier when high quality is received by the retailer, and relational incentives, such as the two parties engaging in a long-term relationship where there is the threat of punishment, affect overall quality and supply chain efficiency. Two of our primary results suggest that (1) relational incentives improve both quality and supply chain efficiency, regardless of whether a monetary incentive is present, and (2) when relational incentives are present, the impact of adding monetary incentives is nonmonotonic: less efficient monetary incentives appear to crowd out the benefits of relational incentives leading even to a reduction in supply chain efficiency, whereas more efficient monetary incentives actually complement relational incentives and lead to significant increases in both quality and supply chain efficiency. We then proceed by demonstrating that a behavioral model of fairness can organize the data quite well.</description><author>Davis, Andrew M.; Hyndman, Kyle</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 May 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Analysts' Reputational Concerns, Self-Censoring, and the International Dispersion Effect</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Hwang, Chuan-Yang; Li, Yuan
Stocks with higher forecast dispersion earn lower future returns and have a greater upward bias in the mean reported earnings forecast in international markets. Both phenomena are stronger in countries with more transparent information environments, more developed stock markets, stronger investor protection, greater capital openness, and more intense usage of analysts' earnings forecasts. Using the 1997-1998 Asian financial crisis as a natural experiment, we find that both phenomena become weaker postcrisis in Malaysia, which imposed capital controls, relative to Thailand and South Korea, which opened their financial markets to foreigners. These results suggest that analysts in countries with greater demand for their forecasts and hence greater concerns for reputations are more likely to self-censor their low forecasts, which leads to a stronger dispersion-bias relation and a stronger dispersion effect.</description><author>Hwang, Chuan-Yang; Li, Yuan</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 May 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>What Calls to ARMs?

The relative popularity of adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) and fixed-rate mortgages (FRMs) varies considerably both across countries and over time. We ask how movements in current and expected future interest rates affect the share of ARMs in total mortgage issuance. Using a nine-country panel and instrumental variables methods, we present evidence that near-term(one-year) rational forecasts of future movements in ARM rates do affect mortgage choice, particularly in more recent data since 2001. However, longer-term (three-year) rational forecasts of ARM rates have a relatively weak effect, and the current spread between FRM and ARM rates also matters, suggesting that households are concerned with current interest costs as well as with lifetime cost minimization. These conclusions are robust to alternative (adaptive and survey-based) models of household expectations.</description><author>Badarinza, Cristian; Campbell, John Y.; Ramadorai, Tarun</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 May 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Unfair Pay and Health</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Falk, Armin; Kosse, Fabian; Menrath, Ingo; Verde, Pablo E.; Siegrist, Johannes
This paper investigates physiological responses to perceptions of unfair pay. We use an integrated approach that exploits complementarities between controlled laboratory and representative panel data. In a simple principal-agent experiment, agents produce revenue by working on a tedious task. Principals decide how this revenue is allocated between themselves and their agents. Throughout the experiment we record agents' heart rate variability, which is an indicator of stress-related impaired cardiac autonomic control and which has been shown to predict coronary heart disease in the long run. Our findings establish a link between unfair payment and heart rate variability. Building on these findings, we further test for potential adverse health effects of unfair pay using observational data from a large representative panel data set. Complementary to our experimental findings we show a strong and significant negative association between unfair pay and health outcomes, in particular cardiovascular health.</description><author>Falk, Armin; Kosse, Fabian; Menrath, Ingo; Verde, Pablo E.; Siegrist, Johannes</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Apr 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Ideation-Execution Transition in Product Development: An Experimental Analysis</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Kagan, Evgeny; Leider, Stephen; Lovejoy, William S.
Bringing a new product to market involves both a creative ideation stage and an execution stage. When time-to-market constraints are binding, important questions are how to divide limited time between the two stages and who should make this decision. We introduce a laboratory experiment that closely resembles this setting: it features a product development task with an open design space, a downstream cost increase, and two development stages. We show that performance is significantly worse when designers choose for themselves when to transition from ideation to execution and that decision control explains a large share of performance variation even after controlling for individual differences. How the time is allocated between ideation and execution does not affect mean performance, but later transition increases risk. One driver of poor design outcomes in the designer-initiated transition regime are delays in physical construction and testing of designs. We show that such delays can be prevented by "nudging" designers toward early prototyping. However, the most important performance driver is the lack of task structure in endogenous regimes, which can be remedied by demanding a concrete, performance-oriented deliverable prior to a transition.</description><author>Kagan, Evgeny; Leider, Stephen; Lovejoy, William S.</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 May 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Reorganization and Tie Decay Choices</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Kleinbaum, Adam M.
Whereas most research on network evolution has focused on the role of interaction opportunities in the formation of new ties, this paper addresses tie decay choices. When the opportunity structure gets reorganized, social actors make choices about which ties to retain and which to allow to decay, informed by their past experience of the tie. I argue that, conditional on changes in opportunity, people (especially those with Machiavellian personalities) choose to retain ties to valuable contacts, they retain reciprocated ties (especially with highly empathic others), and they retain socially embedded ties (especially if they are low self-monitors). The empirical design, which exploits a randomized natural experiment, confirms these hypotheses and suggests that our understanding of tie decay choices-and, consequently, of network evolution-is enhanced by an integrated theoretical perspective that encompasses both social structure and social psychology.</description><author>Kleinbaum, Adam M.</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 May 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Multichannel Distribution Strategy: Selling to a Competing Buyer with Limited Supplier Capacity</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Yang, Zhibin; Hu, Xinxin; Gurnani, Haresh; Guan, Huiqi
We study the optimal distribution strategy of a supplier with limited capacity. The supplier may adopt the supplier-only role, be the solo seller in the market, or use the dual-channel strategy and compete with its downstream buyer. In comparison to the case of unlimited capacity, we show that the supplier, the buyer, and consumers may all benefit from the supplier's limited capacity at the same time, leading to a "win-winwin" outcome. We also find that, under limited capacity, the downstream buyer may order the supplier's entire capacity and strategically withhold some supply from being sold to the market even if there is no underlying supply-side or demand-side uncertainty. Our result points to a new form of strategic purchasing behavior by the buyer in the face of upstream and downstream competition. Interestingly, we show that while buyer withholding is always beneficial for the supplier, it can reduce the buyer's profit under certain cases, although total supply chain profit is the first-best outcome. Also, counter to conventional antitrust concerns, buyer withholding at times may benefit consumers in spite of reduced downstream competition.

Using a sample of equity mutual funds from 26 countries, we find that funds with higher investor-stock decoupling exhibit higher performance, and this is more pronounced during the 2007-2008 financial crisis. We also find that decoupling allows fund managers to take less risk, be more active, and tilt their portfolios toward smaller and less liquid stocks.</description><author>Ferreira, Miguel A.; Massa, Massimo; Matos, Pedro</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 May 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Do Consumers Take Advantage of Common Pricing Standards? An Experimental Investigation</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Sugden, Robert; Zheng, Jiwei
Gaudeul and Sugden [Gaudeul A, Sugden R (2012) Spurious complexity and common standards in markets for consumer goods. Economica 79(314): 209-225] have hypothesized that when some but not all competing products are priced in a common standard, consumers who are liable to make errors in cross-standard price comparisons use decision rules that discriminate in favor of common-standard offers. Such behavior incentivizes sellers to use common standards. We report an experimental test of this hypothesis, using choice tasks similar to those represented in the Gaudeul-Sugden model. We find that offers priced in common standards were more likely to be inspected but less likely to be chosen, and that subjects gained little benefit from common pricing standards that applied to some but not all offers. Most subjects used "dominance editing" operations that eliminated transparently dominated offers, either as an initial shortlisting device or while offers were being sorted. Because these operations discriminate against common-standard offers, their use incentivizes sellers not to use common standards.</description><author>Sugden, Robert; Zheng, Jiwei</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 May 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Asset Pricing with Spatial Interaction</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Kou, Steven; Peng, Xianhua; Zhong, Haowen

In hopes of motivating consumers to provide larger volumes of useful reviews, many retailers offer financial incentives. Here, we explore an alternative approach, social norms. We inform individuals about the volume of reviews authored by peers. We test the effectiveness of using financial incentives, social norms, and a combination of both strategies in motivating consumers. In two randomized experiments, one in the field conducted in partnership with a large online clothing retailer based in China and a second on Amazon Mechanical Turk, we compare the effectiveness of each strategy in stimulating online reviews in larger numbers and of greater length. We find that financial incentives are more effective at inducing larger volumes of reviews, but the reviews that result are not particularly lengthy, whereas social norms have a greater effect on the length of reviews. Importantly, we show that the combination of financial incentives and social norms yields the greatest overall benefit by motivating reviews in greater numbers and of greater length. We further assess treatment-induced self-selection and sentiment bias by triangulating the experimental results with findings from an observational study.</description><author>Burtch, Gordon; Hong, Yili; Bapna, Ravi; Griskevicius, Vladas</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 May 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Behavior-Based Advertising</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Shen, Qiaowei; Villas-Boas, J. Miguel
This paper considers the effect of firms sending advertising messages to consumers based on their past purchase behavior. If past purchase behavior on a product category is positively correlated with a consumer having high preferences in another category, a firm may want to advertise more intensively to those consumers that purchased the former category, if possible. This paper finds that this can lead to lower prices in the initial category if the annoyance of receiving advertising is large, and to higher prices if the annoyance of receiving advertising is not too large, as consumers expect a possible additional surplus from the category affected by behavior-based advertising. If receiving advertising does not yield too much annoyance to consumers, firms end up better off due to both higher prices and the increased demand of better matching of advertising. Behavior-based advertising may also lead firms to sell less in the initial category than without behavior-based advertising, as a way to be able to better target the most valuable consumers. If the consumer annoyance of receiving advertising is large, firms may end up serving only a few consumers initially, as attracting more consumers requires prices that are too low, and the initial consumers are attracted because of the possibility of lower prices in the following period. The paper also investigates the effects of joint behavior-based pricing and advertising, and of different firms benefiting from the purchase information.</description><author>Shen, Qiaowei; Villas-Boas, J.

Extensive debate exists among policy makers and economists about the employment of highly skilled immigrants in the United States. It remains unclear whether these immigrants perform complementary tasks in addition to their substitutive role relative to native graduates. Empirical studies examining these questions in a focused setting are scarce, principally because of the nonavailability of data. We examine these questions using the audit industry as a setting because of the availability of client, city, and office characteristic data at each audit office. This setting also allows us to answer whether immigration can address the growing human capital constraint in the audit industry. We find evidence of a complementary role of highly skilled immigrants. In addition, our results indicate a reputational spillover of client restatements at the audit office level to the labor markets. Our findings have immigration and education policy implications.</description><author>Aobdia, Daniel; Srivastava, Anup; Wang, Erqiu</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 May 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>When Waiting to See a Doctor Is Less Irritating: Understanding Patient Preferences and Choice Behavior in Appointment Scheduling</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Liu, Nan; Finkelstein, Stacey R.; Kruk, Margaret E.; Rosenthal, David
This paper examines patient preferences and choice behavior in scheduling medical appointments. We conduct four discrete choice experiments on two distinct populations and identify several "operational" attributes (e.g., delay to care and choice of doctor) that affect patient choice. We observe an interesting gender effect with respect to how patients trade off speed (delay to care) and quality (doctor of choice), and demonstrate that risk attitudes mediate the impact of gender on the perception of speed and quality. Specifically, females (versus males) are more averse to not seeing their own doctor, and, when delay to care is relatively long, females perceive greater utility loss than males. As many operational strategies in outpatient care aim to improve the patient experience by making trade-offs between speed and quality, we make suggestions for when managers should intervene to improve their practice and how such interventions might look based on the patient mix and current delay level.</description><author>Liu, Nan; Finkelstein, Stacey R.; Kruk, Margaret E.; Rosenthal, David</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 May 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Optimal Price and Delay Differentiation in Large-Scale Queueing Systems</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Maglaras, Costis; Yao, John; Zeevi, Assaf
We study a multiserver queueing model of a revenue-maximizing firm providing a service to a market of heterogeneous price-and delay-sensitive customers with private individual preferences. The firm may offer a selection of service classes that are differentiated in prices and delays. Using a deterministic relaxation, which simplifies the problem by preserving the economic aspects of price-and-delay differentiation while ignoring queueing delays, we construct a solution to the fully stochastic problem that is incentive compatible and near optimal in systems with large capacity and market potential. Our approach provides several new insights for large-scale systems: (i) the deterministic analysis captures all pricing, differentiation, and delay characteristics of the stochastic solution that are nonnegligible at large scale; (ii) service differentiation is optimal when the less delay-sensitive market segment is sufficiently elastic; (iii) the use of "strategic delay" depends on system capacity and market heterogeneity-and it contributes significant delay when the system capacity is underutilized or when the firm offers three or more service classes; and (iv) connecting economic optimization to queueing theory, the revenue-optimized system has the premium class operating in a "quality-driven" regime and the lower-tier service classes operating with noticeable delays that arise either endogenously ("efficiency-driven" regime) or with the addition of strategic delay by the service provider.</description><author>Maglaras, Costis; Yao, John; Zeevi, Assaf</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 May 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Collaboration and Multitasking in Networks: Prioritization and Achievable Capacity</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Gurvich, Itai; Van Mieghem, Jan A.
Motivated by the trend toward more collaboration in workflows, we study networks where some tasks require the simultaneous processing by multiple types of multitasking human or indivisible resources. The capacity of such networks is generally smaller than the bottleneck capacity. In Gurvich and Van Mieghem [Gurvich I, Van Mieghem JA (2015) Collaboration and multitasking in networks: Architectures, bottlenecks, and capacity. Manufacturing Service Oper. Management 17(1): 16-33], we proved that both capacities are equal in networks with a hierarchical collaboration architecture, which define a collaboration level for each task depending on how many types of resources it requires. This paper studies how task prioritization impacts the achievable capacity of such hierarchical networks using a conceptual queueing framework that formalizes coordination and switching idleness. To maximize the capacity of a collaborative network, highest priority must be given to the tasks that require the most collaboration. Otherwise, a mismatch between priority levels and collaboration levels inevitably inflicts a capacity loss. We demonstrate this fundamental tension between flexibility in task prioritization (ability to adjust quality of service) and capacity (productivity) in a basic collaborative network and in parallel networks. To manage this trade-off, we present a hierarchical threshold priority policy that balances switching and coordination idleness.</description><author>Gurvich, Itai; Van Mieghem, Jan A.</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 May 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Anticipated Entry and Entry Deterrence: Evidence from the American Casino Industry</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Cookson, J.

Using new data on entry plans into the American casino industry, I find that incumbent firms invest in physical capacity when threatened with a nearby entry plan, and these strategic investments deter eventual entry. Consistent with an entry-deterrence motive, incumbents respond to the threat of entry when entry is uncertain, but not when entry is assured. The average capacity expansion of 2,300 square feet is associated with a 6.8-percentage-point greater likelihood that the entry plan fails. These findings show that investments in deterrence are viable, especially when new entrants face other significant barriers to entry.</description><author>Cookson, J.

Capital gains taxation has important implications for investors' portfolio choice decisions. To explore these implications, we develop a continuous time investment and consumption model with capital gains tax, Epstein-Zin recursive utility, and regime switching. We find that various factors, such as tax rate, risk aversion, interest rate, stock return, and volatility, jointly affect optimal portfolio allocation, whereas intertemporal substitution does not. In a regime switching market, investors may trade or stop trading purely because of a change in regime, and there is a distinct cross-regime effect on optimal portfolio allocation. In particular, investors tend to raise stock investment in a bear regime so as to reduce potential tax payments upon regime switching. Given reasonable parameter values, regime switching has a greater impact on optimal portfolio allocation in a bear regime than in a bull regime.</description><author>Cai, Jiatu; Chen, Xinfu; Dai, Min</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 May 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Density Dependence of Entrepreneurial Dynamics: Competition, Opportunity Cost, or Minimum Efficient Scale?</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Aksaray, Gorkem; Thompson, Peter

This paper studies the effect of learning information on people's attitudes toward ambiguity. We propose a method to separate ambiguity attitudes from subjective probabilities and to decompose ambiguity attitudes into two components. Under models like prospect theory that represent ambiguity through nonadditive decision weights, these components reflect pessimism and likelihood insensitivity. Under multiple priors models, they reflect ambiguity aversion and perceived ambiguity. We apply our method in an experiment where we elicit the ask prices of options with payoffs depending on the returns of initial public offerings (IPOs) on the New York Stock Exchange. IPOs are a natural context to study the effect of learning, as prior information about their returns is unavailable. Subjects perceived substantial ambiguity and they were insensitive to likelihood information. We observed only little pessimism and ambiguity aversion. Subjective probabilities were well calibrated and close to the true frequencies. Subjects' behavior moved toward expected utility with more information, but substantial deviations remained even in the maximum information condition.</description><author>Baillon, Aurelien; Bleichrodt, Han; Keskin, Umut; l'Haridon, Olivier; Li, Chen</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 May 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Cost Drivers of Versioning: Pricing and Product Line Strategies for Information Goods</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Chellappa, Ramnath K.; Mehra, Amit
In this paper, we extend the understanding of versioning strategy of an information goods monopolist and provide new insights on when versioning is optimal. To do so, we derive the optimal product line or versions of an information good and the corresponding prices. By relaxing common assumptions on consumers' usage costs, versioning costs and capital research and development costs, we provide new insights as well as reconcile extant findings on versioning. For a good with no-free-disposal (NFD), i.e., one where consumers have usage costs, our results show that a monopolist's marginal cost and consumers' usage costs have the same impact on its versioning strategy, and that these factors are the sole reason for optimality of versioning of information goods. By endogenizing the production of the highest-quality, we show that capital costs create a downward distortion of quality even for the highest types in the market even under full information. Presence of separate versioning costs also lowers the qualities served to the high types and reduces the segment of consumers who are served with product versions. However, versioning costs do not affect market coverage or the price-quality menu itself. Further, when some of the consumer usage costs are absorbed by the firm (as in case of cloud-based provisioning), it does not necessarily lead to market expansion.</description><author>Chellappa, Ramnath K.; Mehra, Amit</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 May 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Foreign Risk, Domestic Problem: Capital Allocation and Firm Performance Under Political Instability</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Col, Burcin; Durnev, Art; Molchanov, Alexander
We argue in this paper that firms with foreign operations misallocate capital and underperform when they face political instability abroad. We develop and test a dynamic model of firm capital allocation under foreign political instability. The model shows that as a political regime becomes less stable, independent of whether the regime becomes less business-friendly or more business-friendly, firms invest suboptimally (i.e., they either overinvest or underinvest), and their marginal q's diverge further from an optimal level. Using elections and textual analysis of local media during national elections, we construct a novel index of political instability. We find that U.S. firms and industries with a greater exposure to election-induced political instability experience disruptions of investment efficiency that lead to lower valuations and lower total factor productivity. Therefore, international trade is a significant conduit of foreign political instability into U.S. markets.</description><author>Col, Burcin; Durnev, Art; Molchanov, Alexander</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 May 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Revenue-Maximizing Mechanisms with Strategic Customers and Unknown, Markovian Demand</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Gershkov, Alex; Moldovanu, Benny; Strack, Philipp
We show that appropriate dynamic pricing strategies can be used to draw benefits from the presence of consumers who strategically time their purchase even if the arrival process is not known. In our model, a seller sells a stock of objects to a stream of randomly arriving long-lived agents. Agents are privately informed about their values, and about their arrival time to the market. The seller needs to learn about future demand from past arrivals. We characterize the revenue-maximizing direct mechanism. While the optimal mechanism cannot be reduced to posted prices (and requires personalized prices), we also present a simple, "learn and then sell" mechanism that is able to extract a large fraction of the maximal revenue. In this mechanism, the seller first charges a relatively low price that allows learning about the arrival process, and in a second stage, the seller charges the optimal posted price given the previously obtained information.</description><author>Gershkov, Alex; Moldovanu, Benny; Strack, Philipp</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 May 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>On the Size of the Gender Difference in Competitiveness</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Saccardo, Silvia; Pietrasz, Aniela; Gneezy, Uri
We design a new procedure for measuring competitiveness and use it to estimate the magnitude of the gender gap in competitiveness. Before working on a task, participants choose what percentage of their payoffs will be based on a piece-rate compensation scheme; the rest of their payoff is allocated to a competitive compensation scheme. This novel procedure allows us to distinguish between 101 levels of competitiveness, as opposed to the binary measure used in the literature. Whereas the binary measure allows researchers to conclude that about twice as many men as women choose to compete (typically two-thirds versus one-third), the new procedure sheds light on the intensive margin. We find that the intensity of the preference is more extreme than the binary measure could detect. For example, we find that only one-fifth of the most competitive 25% of our participants are women, and the most competitive 10% of our participants are all men. The new procedure also allows us to study the correlation between competitiveness and parameters such as overconfidence, attitudes toward risk, and ambiguity.</description><author>Saccardo, Silvia; Pietrasz, Aniela; Gneezy, Uri</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Apr 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>The Impact of Consumer Multi-homing on Advertising Markets and Media Competition</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Athey, Susan; Calvano, Emilio; Gans, Joshua S.
We develop a model of advertising markets in an environment where consumers may switch (or "multi-home") across publishers. Consumer switching generates inefficiency in the process of matching advertisers to consumers, because advertisers may not reach some consumers and may impress others too many times. We find that when advertisers are heterogeneous in their valuations for reaching consumers, the switching-induced inefficiency leads lower-value advertisers to advertise on a limited set of publishers, reducing the effective demand for advertising and thus depressing prices. As the share of switching consumers expands (e.g., when consumers adopt the Internet for news or increase their use of aggregators), ad prices fall. We demonstrate that increased switching creates an incentive for publishers to invest in quality as well as extend the number of unique users, because larger publishers are favored by advertisers seeking broader "reach" (more unique users) while avoiding inefficient duplication.</description><author>Athey, Susan; Calvano, Emilio; Gans, Joshua S.</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Apr 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Persistence and Procyclicality in Margin Requirements</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Glasserman, Paul; Wu, Qi
Margin requirements for derivative contracts serve as a buffer against the transmission of losses through the financial system by protecting one party to a contract against default by the other party. However, if margin levels are proportional to volatility, then a spike in volatility leads to potentially destabilizing margin calls in times of market stress. Risk-sensitive margin requirements are thus procyclical in the sense that they amplify shocks. We use a GARCH model of volatility and a combination of theoretical and empirical results to analyze how much higher margin levels need to be to avoid procyclicality while reducing counterparty credit risk. Our analysis compares the tail decay of conditional and unconditional loss distributions with comparable stable and risk-sensitive margin requirements. Greater persistence and burstiness in volatility leads to a slower decay in the tail of the unconditional distribution and a higher buffer needed to avoid procyclicality. The tail decay drives other measures of procyclicality as well. Our analysis points to important features of price time series that should inform "antiprocyclicality" measures but are missing from current rules.</description><author>Glasserman, Paul; Wu, Qi</author><pubDate>Sat, 01 Dec 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Offline Showrooms in Omnichannel Retail: Demand and Operational Benefits</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Bell, David R.; Gallino, Santiago; Moreno, Antonio
Omnichannel environments where customers shop online and offline at the same retailer are ubiquitous, and are deployed by online-first and traditional retailers alike. We focus on the relatively understudied domain of online-first retailers and the engagement of a key omnichannel tactic; specifically, introduction of showrooms (physical locations where customers can view and try products) in combination with online fulfillment that uses centralized inventory management. We ask whether, and if so, how, showrooms benefit the two most basic retail objectives: demand generation and operational efficiency. Using quasi-experimental data on showroom openings by WarbyParker. com, the leading and iconic online-first eyewear retailer, we find that showrooms: (1) increase demand overall and in the online channel as well; (2) generate operational spillovers to the other channels by attracting customers who, on average, have a higher cost-to-serve; (3) improve overall operational efficiency by increasing conversion in a sampling channel and by decreasing returns; and (4) amplify these demand and operational benefits in dealing with customers who have the most acute need for the firm's products. Moreover, the effects we document strengthen with time as showrooms contribute not only to brand awareness but also to what we term channel awareness as well. We conclude by elaborating the underlying customer dynamics driving our findings and by offering implications for how online-first retailers might deploy omnichannel tactics.</description><author>Bell, David R.; Gallino, Santiago; Moreno, Antonio</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Apr 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Segmentation of Spatially Dependent Geographical Units: Model and Application</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Govind, Rahul; Chatterjee, Rabikar; Mittal, Vikas

Such concentrated segments are managerially desirable because of the logistical and administrative efficiencies created by implementing spatially concentrated segment-level strategies. The suggested approach captures spatial dependence flexibly while allowing us to identify managerially actionable segments that effectively balance homogeneity and spatial concentration. An illustrative empirical application demonstrates how the results can be utilized to derive consumer insights for actionable segmentation strategies. A Monte Carlo simulation and an assessment of the quality of the segments obtained from the empirical application support the value of the proposed spatially dependent segmentation method.</description><author>Govind, Rahul; Chatterjee, Rabikar; Mittal, Vikas</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Apr 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Deadlines, Workflows, Task Sorting, and Work Quality</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Balasubramanian, Natarajan; Lee, Jeongsik; Sivadasan, Jagadeesh
Deadlines are often used to manage the time of valuable human capital. In this multimethod paper, we propose a theoretical framework grounded in a formal model that encapsulates the key drivers and consequences of deadline-related time pressures on workflows, task sorting, and work quality. We use large-scale data on patent filings, along with insights from primary data collection, to test our hypotheses. In line with our predictions, we find clustering of patent filings around month-ends, with month-end applications being more complex than those filed on other days. Consistent with time pressure reducing work quality, we find that work quality is lower for tasks completed at month-ends, more so for process measures of quality than for outcome measures. Calibration of our model to the data allows us to shed light on the benefits of deadlines and suggests small levels of task acceleration but potentially larger working capital-related benefits for law firms.</description><author>Balasubramanian, Natarajan; Lee, Jeongsik; Sivadasan, Jagadeesh</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Apr 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>The Wisdom of Crowds in Matters of Taste</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Mueller-Trede, Johannes; Choshen-Hillel, Shoham; Barneron, Meir; Yaniv, Ilan
Decision makers can often improve the accuracy of their judgments on factual matters by consulting "crowds" of others for their respective opinions. In this article, we investigate whether decision makers could similarly draw on crowds to improve the accuracy of their judgments about their own tastes and hedonic experiences. We present a theoretical model that states that accuracy gains from consulting a crowd's judgments of taste depend on the interplay among taste discrimination, crowd diversity, and the similarity between the crowd's preferences and those of the decision maker. The model also delineates the boundary conditions for such "crowd wisdom." Evidence supporting our hypotheses was found in two laboratory studies in which decision makers made judgments about their own enjoyment of musical pieces and short films. Our findings suggest that although different people may have different preferences and inclinations, their judgments of taste can benefit from the wisdom of crowds.</description><author>Mueller-Trede, Johannes; Choshen-Hillel, Shoham; Barneron, Meir; Yaniv, Ilan</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Apr 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Can Unspanned Stochastic Volatility Models Explain the Cross Section of Bond Volatilities?</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Joslin, Scott
In fixed income markets, volatility is unspanned if volatility risk cannot be hedged with bonds. We first show that all affine term structure models with state space R-+(M) x RN-M can be drift normalized and show when the standard variance normalization can be obtained. Using this normalization, we find conditions for a wide class of affine term structure models to exhibit unspanned stochastic volatility (USV). We show that the USV conditions restrict both the mean reversions of risk factors and the cross section of conditional yield volatilities.

We analyze the entry of newcredit rating agencies into structured finance products. Our setting is unique as we study a period in which the incumbents' reputation was extremely poor and the benefit of more fee income from inflating ratings was low. We find entrants issue higher ratings than incumbents, particularly for interest-only tranches. Using measures of market share that are exogenous to incumbent ratings, we provide suggestive evidence that incumbent rating levels become more generous as entrant market share in a product type increases. We also exploit a feature of structured finance that identifies rating shopping and find that incumbent ratings increase in shopping.</description><author>Flynn, Sean; Ghent, Andra</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Apr 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>A Partial-Order-Based Model to Estimate Individual Preferences Using Panel Data</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Jagabathula, Srikanth; Vulcano, Gustavo
In retail operations, customer choices may be affected by stockout and promotion events. Given panel data with the transaction history of customers, and product availability and promotion data, our goal is to predict future individual purchases. We use a general nonparametric framework in which we represent customers by partial orders of preferences. In each store visit, each customer samples a full preference list of the products consistent with her partial order, forms a consideration set, and then chooses to purchase the most preferred product among the considered ones. Our approach involves: (a) defining behavioral models to build consideration sets as subsets of the products on offer, (b) proposing a clustering algorithm for determining customer segments, and (c) deriving marginal distributions for partial preferences under the multinomial logit model. Numerical experiments on real-world panel data show that our approach allows more accurate, fine-grained predictions for individual purchase behavior compared to state-of-the-art alternative methods.</description><author>Jagabathula, Srikanth; Vulcano, Gustavo</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Apr 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Socially and Environmentally Responsible Value Chain Innovations: New Operations Management Research Opportunities</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Lee, Hau L.; Tang, Christopher S.

Existing results show that (i) lagged forward rates help predict bond returns and (ii) modern Markovian dynamic term structure models (DTSMs) cannot match the evidence [Cochrane JH, Piazzesi M (2005) Bond risk premia. Amer. Econom. Rev. 95(1): 138-160]. We develop the family of conditional mean DTSMs where the dynamics depend on current yields and their history through a moving-average component. Our preferred conditional mean model combines one moving average with the usual three Gaussian risk factors, closely matches the bond risk premium measured from predictive regressions, and provides better forecasts of bond returns. Our framework nests Duffee's models with a small "hidden" factor [Duffee G (2011) Information in (and not in) the term structure. Rev. Financial Stud. 24(9): 2895-2934], and our results compare favorably with his five-factor model. Conditional mean models are easier to estimate than state-space term structure models based on Kalman estimates of latent factors.</description><author>Feunou, Bruno; Fontaine, Jean-Sebastien</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Mar 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Cry Wolf or Equivocate? Credible Forecast Guidance in a Cost-Loss Game</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Bolton, Gary E.; Katok, Elena
What is the most credible way to convey the risk in expert forecasts to the nonexpert decision makers who use the forecast? We test two ways to communicate this information: provide an unequivocal recommendation or equivocate by providing the probability of the uncertain event of interest. We use a simple game in which human subjects (the forecast users) decide whether to take a risk of a loss or pay a cost to avoid the risk. We find that the influence of forecast information differs depending on whether the information implies that the decision maker should take the status quo action, the preforecast optimal action, or the siren action, optimal only if the period-by-period forecast implies it. Unequivocal recommendations are more successful at inducing the status quo action. Equivocating by providing probabilities is more successful at inducing the siren action. Unequivocal recommendations to take the siren action are less effective because the false certainty makes them more vulnerable to the "cry wolf" effect. A forecast that combines probabilities with recommendations captures most of the gains of the separate approaches. A follow-up study examines whether an explanation of how risk quantities inform recommendations can substitute for providing the risk quantities in the forecast. The study finds little evidence in support of this proposition.</description><author>Bolton, Gary E.; Katok, Elena</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Mar 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Spillover Effects Within Business Groups: The Case of Korean Chaebols</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Joe, Denis Yongmin; Oh, Frederick Dongchuhl
We examine the spillover effects that occur within Korean business groups (i.e., chaebols) by focusing on the market reactions of event firms to announcements of credit rating changes. We find that there are positive spillovers (caused by positive market reactions) and negative spillovers (caused by negative market reactions) that are driven by the market reactions of event firms. Our analyses indicate that negative spillovers are more dominant than positive spillovers. Moreover, a spillover that is driven by a leading firm within a business group has stronger effects on other firms in the group than a spillover that is driven by a nonleading firm. This suggests that the market evaluation of a business group is conducted more on the basis of a leading firm than a nonleading firm within a group. Finally, we show that the spillover effects that are analyzed in our study are more noticeable when the business relationship between an event firmand other affiliated firms is closer.</description><author>Joe, Denis Yongmin; Oh, Frederick Dongchuhl</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Mar 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Betting Your Favorite to Win: Costly Reluctance to Hedge Desired Outcomes</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Morewedge, Carey K.; Tang, Simone; Larrick, Richard P.
We examined whether people reduce the impact of negative outcomes through emotional hedging-betting against the occurrence of desired outcomes. We found substantial reluctance to bet against the success of preferred U.S. presidential candidates and Major League Baseball, National Football League, National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) basketball, and NCAA hockey teams. This reluctance was not attributable to optimism or a general aversion to hedging. Reluctance to hedge desired outcomes stemmed from identity signaling, a desire to preserve an important aspect of the bettor's identity. Reluctance to hedge occurred when the diagnostic cost of the negative self-signal that hedging would produce outweighed the pecuniary rewards associated with hedging. Participants readily accepted hedges and pure gambles with no diagnostic costs. They also more readily accepted hedges with diagnostic costs when the pecuniary rewards associated with those hedges were greater. Reluctance to hedge identity-relevant outcomes produced two anomalies in decision making, risk seeking and dominance violations. More than 45% of NCAA fans in Studies 5 and 6, for instance, turned down a "free" real $5 bet against their team. The results elucidate anomalous decisions in which people exhibit disloyalty aversion, forgoing personal rewards that would conflict with their loyalties and commitments to others, beliefs, and ideals.</description><author>Morewedge, Carey K.; Tang, Simone; Larrick, Richard P.</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Mar 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Are Markets with Loss-Averse Consumers More Sensitive to Losses?</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Hu, Zhenyu; Nasiry, Javad
Behavioral pricing and revenue management aim to incorporate realistic consumer behavior into firms' pricing and inventory models. The key input to these models is market demand, which is often assumed to inherit the characteristics of consumer behavior-as when, for example, one assumes that a market consisting of loss-averse consumers is more responsive to losses than to gains. Yet market demand and consumer behavior need not be related, and so, we argue, that approach to modeling market demand is misguided. This paper proposes an approach that accounts for the heterogeneity in consumer valuation: we aggregate the demand of individual loss-averse consumers to obtain market demand and show that market demand may be more responsive to gains or losses, or it may be equally responsive. Our results have profound implications not only for how best to characterize the market demand of behaviorally biased consumers but also for determining the firm's optimal pricing policy.</description><author>Hu, Zhenyu; Nasiry, Javad</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Mar 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Advertiser Prominence Effects in Search Advertising</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Jeziorski, Przemyslaw; Moorthy, Sridhar
Search advertising is the ordered list of advertisements that appears when a user searches for something in an online search engine. By construction, these ads differ in prominence: ads higher up the list are more prominent than ads lower down the list. However, search ads also differ in prominence in another way: prominence of advertiser. This paper examines how these two types of prominence interact in determining the click-through rate (CTR) of these ads. Using individual-level click-stream data from Microsoft's Live Search platform and measures of advertiser prominence from Alexa. com, we find that ad position and advertiser prominence are substitutes. Specifically, in searches for camera brands, a retailer not in the top 100 of Alexa rankings has a 30%-50% higher CTR in position 1 than in position 2, whereas a retailer in the top 100 of Alexa rankings has only a 0%-13% higher CTR for the same position improvement. Qualitatively similar results are obtained for several other search strings. These findings demonstrate, first, that advertiser brand matters even for search ads, and, second, the way it matters is the opposite of what is usually assumed in the theoretical literature on search advertising.</description><author>Jeziorski, Przemyslaw; Moorthy, Sridhar</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Mar 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Enculturation Trajectories: Language, Cultural Adaptation, and Individual Outcomes in Organizations</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Srivastava, Sameer B.; Goldberg, Amir; Manian, V.

How do people adapt to organizational culture, and what are the consequences for their outcomes in the organization? These fundamental questions about culture have previously been examined using self-report measures, which are subject to reporting bias, rely on coarse cultural categories defined by researchers, and provide only static snapshots of cultural fit. By contrast, we develop an interactional language use model that overcomes these limitations and opens new avenues for theoretical development about the dynamics of organizational culture. We trace the enculturation trajectories of employees in a midsized technology firm based on analyses of 10.24 million internal emails. Our language-based model of changing cultural fit (1) predicts individual attainment; (2) reveals distinct patterns of adaptation for employees who exit voluntarily, exit involuntarily, and remain employed; (3) demonstrates that rapid early cultural adaptation reduces the risk of involuntary, but not voluntary, exit; and (4) finds that a decline in cultural fit for individuals who had successfully enculturated portends voluntary departure.</description><author>Srivastava, Sameer B.; Goldberg, Amir; Manian, V.

"Short Termism" and the Puzzle of Only Occasional Disaster</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Rahmandad, Hazhir; Henderson, Rebecca; Repenning, Nelson P.
Recent work suggests that an excessive focus on "managing the numbers"-delivering quarterly earnings at the expense of longer-term performance-makes it difficult for firms to make the investments necessary to build competitive advantage. "Short termism" has been blamed for everything from the decline of the U.S. automobile industry to the low penetration of techniques such as total quality management and continuous improvement. Yet a significant body of research suggests that firms that sacrifice long-term investment to manage earnings are often rewarded for doing so. This paper presents a model to help reconcile the tension between these apparently contradictory perspectives. We show that if the source of long-term advantage is modeled as a stock of capability that accumulates over time, the intensity of the firm's effort to manage short-term earnings at the expense of long-term investment can have very different consequences depending on whether the firm's capability is close to a critical "tipping threshold." When the firm operates above this threshold, aggressively managing earnings smooths revenue and cash flow with few long-term consequences. Below it, managing earnings can tip the firm into a vicious cycle of accelerating decline. Our results have important implications for understanding managerial incentives and the internal processes that create sustained advantage.</description><author>Rahmandad, Hazhir; Henderson, Rebecca; Repenning, Nelson P.</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Mar 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Collaborative Consumption: Strategic and Economic Implications of Product Sharing</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Jiang, Baojun; Tian, Lin
Recent technological advances in online and mobile communications have enabled collaborative consumption or product sharing among consumers on a massive scale. Collaborative consumption has emerged as a major trend as the global economic recession and social concerns about consumption sustainability lead consumers and society as a whole to explore more efficient use of resources and products. We develop an analytical framework to examine the strategic and economic impact of product sharing among consumers. Aconsumer who purchased a firm's product can derive different usage values across different usage periods. In a period with low self-use value, the consumer may generate some income by renting out her purchased product through a third-party sharing platform as long as the rental fee net of transaction costs exceeds her own self-use value. Our analysis shows that transaction costs in the sharing market have a nonmonotonic effect on the firm's profits, consumer surplus, and social welfare. We find that when the firm strategically chooses its retail price, consumers' sharing of products with high marginal costs is a win-win situation for the firm and the consumers, whereas their sharing of products with low marginal costs can be a lose-lose situation. Furthermore, in the presence of the sharing market, the firm will find it optimal to strategically increase its quality, leading to higher profits but lower consumer surplus.</description><author>Jiang, Baojun; Tian, Lin</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Mar 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Machine Learning and Portfolio Optimization</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Ban, Gah-Yi; El Karoui, Noureddine; Lim, Andrew E. B.
The portfolio optimization model has limited impact in practice because of estimation issues when applied to real data. To address this, we adapt two machine learning methods, regularization and cross-validation, for portfolio optimization. First, we introduce performance-based regularization (PBR), where the idea is to constrain the sample variances of the estimated portfolio risk and return, which steers the solution toward one associated with less estimation error in the performance. We consider PBR for both mean-variance and mean-conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) problems. For the mean-variance problem, PBR introduces a quartic polynomial constraint, for which we make two convex approximations: one based on rank-1 approximation and another based on a convex quadratic approximation. The rank-1 approximation PBR adds a bias to the optimal allocation, and the convex quadratic approximation PBR shrinks the sample covariance matrix. For the mean-CVaR problem, the PBR model is a combinatorial optimization problem, but we prove its convex relaxation, a quadratically constrained quadratic program, is essentially tight. We show that the PBR models can be cast as robust optimization problems with novel uncertainty sets and establish asymptotic optimality of both sample average approximation (SAA) and PBR solutions and the corresponding efficient frontiers. To calibrate the right-hand sides of the PBR constraints, we develop new, performance-based k-fold cross-validation algorithms. Using these algorithms, we carry out an extensive empirical investigation of PBR against SAA, as well as L1 and L2 regularizations and the equally weighted portfolio. We find that PBR dominates all other benchmarks for two out of three Fama-French data sets.</description><author>Ban, Gah-Yi; El Karoui, Noureddine; Lim, Andrew E.

Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulations in 1975 gave select rating agencies increased market power by increasing both barriers to entry and the reliance on ratings for regulations. We test whether these regulations led to ratings inflation. We find that defaults and negative financial changes are more likely for firms given the same rating if the rating was assigned after the SEC action. Furthermore, firms initially rated Baa in the post-regulation period are 19% more likely to be negatively downgraded to speculative grade than firms rated Baa in the pre-regulation period.

The executive suite and the board are closely bound to each other through their fiduciary responsibility to the same shareholders. With chief executive officers' (CEOs) prominent role in both governing bodies, their independence from CEOs' self-serving behavior might be related to each other. We explore the interdependence using an external shock increasing board independence. The shock weakens executive suite independence by increasing CEO connectedness within executive suites through appointments and preexisting social ties. We also uncover interesting dynamics between the two governing bodies: (1) the spillover does not occur when treated firms increase CEO-independent director social ties, suggesting CEO-executive connections and CEO-director connections are substitutes; (2) consistent with theories of board independence, when an information environment calls for dependent boards, increasing CEO-executive connections, which helps negate the shock effect on the board, has positive marginal effects on firm performance. Our findings are not driven by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and are robust to a battery of other tests. We conclude that independence in the board and executive suite are inversely related; inferring the overall independence from board independence alone can be highly misleading.</description><author>Kim, E.

We study how people reconcile conflicting moral intuitions by juxtaposing two versions of classic moral problems: the trolley problem and the footbridge problem. When viewed separately, most people favor action in the former and disapprove of action in the latter, despite identical consequences. The difference is often explained in terms of the intention principle-whether the consequences are intended or incidental. Our results suggest that when the two problems are considered together, a different judgment emerges: participants reject the intention principle and embrace either the principle of utilitarianism, which favors action in both problems, or the action principle, which rejects action in both problems. In subsequent studies, we find that when required to choose between two harmful actions, people prefer the action that saves more lives, despite its being more aversive. Our findings shed light on the formation of moral judgment under normative conflict, the conditions for preference reversal, and the potential polarization of moral judgment under joint evaluation.

A growing empirical literature uses patent citations as a quality-adjusted measure for innovation, despite concerns about the validity of this measure. This paper links patents with objective measures of improvements in the quality of patented inventionsmeasured through performance in field trials for hybrid corn-to examine three potential factors that influence citations: (1) improvements in performance, (2) citing practices of patent attorneys, and (3) citing practices of patent examiners. This analysis reveals that citations are robustly correlated with performance, which confirms that citations are a useful quality-adjusted measure for innovation. The citing practices of patent attorneys and examiners, however, also influence citations. Patent attorneys cite early patents, which help establish the patentability of an invention; this practice may inflate citation counts for early patents, particularly for inventions that have only recently become patentable. Attorneys also add self-citations; our analysis indicates that self-citations are an indicator of follow-on invention. By comparison, examiner-added citations are typically unrelated to improvements in performance or follow-on invention.</description><author>Moser, Petra; Ohmstedt, Joerg; Rhode, Paul W.</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Apr 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Individual Reaction to Past Performance Sequences: Evidence from a Real Marketplace</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Andrikogiannopoulou, Angie; Papakonstantinou, Filippos

The idiosyncratic nature of risk in this market and the revelation of assets' true terminal values enables us to disentangle whether behavior is caused by sentiment or by superior information about market mispricings and to cleanly test two prominent theories of momentum and reversals-the regime-shifting model of Barberis et al.

Furthermore, our long panel enables us to study the prevalence across individuals of each type of behavior.

Y.
A paradox in organizational research on judgment and decision making is that although the law-of-effect in adaptive learning suggests that people's tendency to take a decision decreases after the decision receives negative consequences, people often exhibit an opposite action pattern of escalation of commitment. To address this paradox, this paper proposes that the unit of law-of-effect can be extended from a decision level to a strategy level (i.e., a group of planned decisions). A strategy organizes decisions from being consistent with the law-of-effect in one extreme to being consistent with escalation of commitment in another extreme. This paper shows that the favorability of the law-ofeffect strategy (versus the escalation strategy) is likely to be underestimated at the beginning of a learning process. This underestimation stabilizes over time because negative consequences decrease the likelihood of choosing the law-of-effect strategy in the future. Accordingly, escalation strategy will be preferred more in the learning process, thereby developing a pattern of behaviors that is contradictory to the law-of-effect at the decision level but consistent with the law-of-effect at the strategy level. This learning pattern was demonstrated in three simulations with different combinations that were specified to capture different aspects of escalation of commitment. This learning perspective offers a novel explanation of escalation, suggesting that escalation may occur without distorted motivation or cognition.</description><author>Wong, Kin Fai Ellick; Kwong, Jessica Y.

Across consequential attributions of attitudes, ability, emotions, and morality, people make correspondent inferences. People infer stable personality characteristics from others' behavior, even when that behavior is caused by situational factors. We examined the structure of correspondent inferences and report the development and validation of an instrument measuring individual differences in this correspondence bias (a Neglect of External Demands scale, or "NED"). The NED is internally consistent and distinct from scales and measures of intelligence, cognitive ability, cognitive reflection, general decisionmaking ability, preference for control, and attributional style. Individual differences in correspondence bias predict blaming people for harmful accidents, believing coerced confessions, correcting for job and task difficulty when making performance evaluations and incentive-compatible personnel selections, and separating market and fund performance when making incentive-compatible investments. Fortunately, the tendency to commit correspondence bias can be reduced. Making situational information easier to process debiases those most prone to correspondence bias.</description><author>Scopelliti, Irene; Min, H.

Using a comprehensive longitudinal data set on deal offerings and sales across local markets, and combining it with local market characteristics, we estimate a simultaneous equation model of the weekly number of deal offerings and deal sales characterizing the two-sided nature of the platform. We find that the word-of-mouth effect on the consumer side and the observational learning effect on the merchant side contribute to and reinforce the expansion of a two-sided platform. However, a larger number of deals intensifies the competition, which then lowers per deal sales and limits the number of deal offerings. We find that local characteristics have significant impact on both the deal demand and the supply side. We further use model simulation to show how differences in growth patterns across markets may be driven by local characteristics, and we decompose their relative impact on the demand and supply sides. The paper provides managerial implications for firms specializing in O2O commerce.</description><author>Li, Hui; Shen, Qiaowei; Bart, Yakov</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Apr 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Does Technology Substitute for Nurses? Staffing Decisions in Nursing Homes</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Lu, Susan F.; Rui, Huaxia; Seidmann, Abraham
Over the past 10 years, many healthcare organizations have made significant investments in automating their clinical operations, mostly through the introduction of advanced information systems. Yet the impact of these investments on staffing is still not well understood. In this paper, we study the effect of information technology (IT)enabled automation on staffing decisions in healthcare facilities. Using unique nursing home IT data from 2006 to 2012, we find that the licensed nurse staffing level decreases by 5.8% in high-end nursing homes but increases by 7.6% in low-end homes after the adoption of automation technology. Our research explains this by analyzing the interplay of two competing effects of automation: the substitution of technology for labor and the leveraging of complementarity between technology and labor. We also find that increased automation improves the ratings on clinical quality by 6.9% and decreases admissions of less profitable residents by 14.7% on average. These observations are consistent with the predictions of an analytical staffing model that incorporates technology adoption and vertical differentiation. Overall, these findings suggest that the impact of automation technology on staffing decisions depends crucially on a facility's vertical position in the local marketplace.</description><author>Lu, Susan F.; Rui, Huaxia; Seidmann, Abraham</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Apr 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Testosterone and Tendency to Engage in Self-Employment</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Nicolaou, Nicos; Patel, Pankaj C.; Wolfe, Marcus T.
Does testosterone increase the tendency to engage in self-employment? The results presented to date have been mixed. Using three different studies, we provide additional evidence on the relationship between testosterone and self-employment. Drawing on a cross section of 2,146 individuals (1,178 males and 968 females) from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys' 2011-2012 sample, and controlling for endogeneity (with red blood cell count, percentage hematocrit, and zinc supplement intake in the past 30 days as instruments), we find that serum testosterone levels are positively associated with self-employment for males (marginally significant, two-tailed test). As testosterone levels could be affected by social, economic, and biological factors during one's life course, we draw more robust inferences by assessing whether the 2D:4D digit ratio, a marker of prenatal testosterone exposure, influences the likelihood of self-employment. From Understanding Society's Innovation Panel Wave 6, we tested separate models for 449 males and 525 females, and our results indicate that males (respectively, females) with a lower 2D:4D ratio in their left hand, or higher prenatal testosterone exposure, have a significantly greater (respectively, marginally significant) likelihood of self-employment (two-tailed test). Finally, we examine the twin testosterone transfer effect in a sample of opposite-sex and same-sex twins from the National Survey of Midlife Development in the United States and provide additional support for the marginally significant (two-tailed test) positive association between testosterone and self-employment.</description><author>Nicolaou, Nicos; Patel, Pankaj C.; Wolfe, Marcus T.</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Apr 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Sunk Cost Fallacy in Driving the World's Costliest Cars</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Ho, Teck-Hua; Png, I. P. L.; Reza, Sadat
We develop a behavioral model of durable good usage with mental accounting for sunk costs. It predicts higher-than-rational usage that attenuates at a rate that increases with sunk costs. Singapore government policy varied the sunk cost of buying a new car. Using Singapore data, we estimate the elasticity of driving with respect to sunk costs to be 0.048, which implies that government policy between 2009 and 2013 was associated with 86 kilometers per month, or 5.6%, more driving. The results are robust to specifying sunk costs as relative to buyer income and estimation with Hong Kong data. We believe this to be the first field evidence of the sunk cost fallacy in usage of a major durable good.</description><author>Ho, Teck-Hua; Png, I. P.

Automated valuation models (AVMs) are widely used in the valuation of pools of residential mortgages. In this paper, we provide evidence that high pricing errors in human and automated valuation models as well as rejection of loans with relatively low appraisals may generate the appearance of appraisal bias even when the original appraisals are unbiased. We also present evidence that the estimated frequency of appraisal overstatement is quite sensitive to assumptions about loan denial rates due to low appraisals as well as the size of and the correlation between AVM and original appraisal pricing errors.</description><author>Demiroglu, Cem; James, Christopher</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Apr 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Crowdsourcing Exploration</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Papanastasiou, Yiangos; Bimpikis, Kostas; Savva, Nicos
Motivated by the proliferation of online platforms that collect and disseminate consumers' experiences with alternative substitutable products/ services, we investigate the problem of optimal information provision when the goal is to maximize aggregate consumer surplus. We develop a decentralized multiarmed bandit framework where a forward- looking principal (the platform designer) commits up front to a policy that dynamically discloses information regarding the history of outcomes to a series of shortlived rational agents (the consumers). We demonstrate that consumer surplus is nonmonotone in the accuracy of the designer's information- provision policy. Because consumers are constantly in "exploitation" mode, policies that disclose accurate information on past outcomes suffer from inadequate "exploration." We illustrate how the designer can (partially) alleviate this inefficiency by employing a policy that strategically obfuscates the information in the platform's possession; interestingly, such a policy is beneficial despite the fact that consumers are aware of both the designer's objective and the precise way by which information is being disclosed to them. More generally, we show that the optimal information- provision policy can be obtained as the solution of a large- scale linear program. Noting that such a solution is typically intractable, we use our structural findings to design an intuitive heuristic that underscores the value of information obfuscation in decentralized learning. We further highlight that obfuscation remains beneficial even if the designer can directly incentivize consumers to explore through monetary payments.</description><author>Papanastasiou, Yiangos; Bimpikis, Kostas; Savva, Nicos</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Apr 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Hidden Skewness: On the Difficulty of Multiplicative Compounding Under Random Shocks</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Ensthaler, Ludwig; Nottmeyer, Olga; Weizsaecker, Georg; Zankiewicz, Christian
Multiplicative growth processes that are subject to random shocks often have an asymmetric distribution of outcomes. In a series of incentivized laboratory experiments, we showthat a large majority of participants either strongly underestimate the asymmetry or ignore it completely. Participants misperceive the spread of the outcome distribution to be too narrowband, and they estimate the median and the mode to lie too close to the center of the distribution, failing to account for the compound nature of average growth. The observed biases are measured irrespective to risk preferences and they appear under a variety of conditions. The biases are largely consistent with a behavioral model in which geometric growth is confused with linear growth. This confusion is a possible driver of investors' difficulties with real-world financial products like leveraged exchange- traded funds and retirement savings plans.</description><author>Ensthaler, Ludwig; Nottmeyer, Olga; Weizsaecker, Georg; Zankiewicz, Christian</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Apr 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Acquisitions, Node Collapse, and Network Revolution</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Hernandez, Exequiel; Menon, Anoop
We explore a novel mechanism of network change that occurs when a firm acquires another one and inherits its network ties. Such "node collapse" can radically restructure the network in one transaction, constituting a revolutionary change compared with the incremental effect of tie additions and deletions, which have been the focus of prior research. We explore several properties of node collapses: their efficacy in helping firms achieve superior network positions, the externalities they impose on other network actors, and how they provide exclusive control over both internal and network resources. Using a simulation in which actors compete to acquire one another, we model network dynamics driven by node collapses. We find that node collapses directly affect the performance of the acquirer and indirectly that of other actors, and that the direction of network evolution hinges on the degree to which firms pursue internal versus network synergies through node collapses.</description><author>Hernandez, Exequiel; Menon, Anoop</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Apr 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Targeting Target Shareholders</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Bernhardt, Dan; Liu, Tingjun; Marquez, Robert
We integrate heterogeneity and uncertainty in investor valuations into a model of takeovers.

We derive the consequences for an acquiring firm's takeover offer-its size and cash/equity structure-and implications for takeover premia, firm returns, share price dynamics, the probability that a takeover succeeds, and shareholder welfare. We characterize when the acquirer prefers cash offers and when equity offers are best. Our model collectively reconciles various empirical regularities that have proven elusive to explain in one unified framework, and we derive new testable predictions.</description><author>Bernhardt, Dan; Liu, Tingjun; Marquez, Robert</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Apr 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Structural Role Complementarity in Entrepreneurial Teams</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Aven, Brandy; Hillmann, Henning
To refine the understanding of the social network characteristics of entrepreneurial teams, we present a new construct: structural role complementarity. In particular, we examine the variation between team members' respective abilities to act as network brokers. Based on the cofounding networks of 9,461 entrepreneurs and 2,446 large-scale industrial enterprises over 45 years in Russia's emerging economy (1869-1913), our findings show that variation among team members' brokering ability significantly predicts the starting capital raised by their firm. The effect is moderated by the team's average brokering potential. When both the team's average and variation in brokering potential is high, firms raise greater starting capital. By using multiple membership models, we demonstrate that greater starting capital is largely attributable to team factors rather than the attributes of the individual team members. We also take advantage of discriminatory laws that were passed in 1887 in an instrumental variable analysis to address potential endogeneity issues.</description><author>Aven, Brandy; Hillmann, Henning</author><pubDate>Sat, 01 Dec 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Pricing with Cookies: Behavior-Based Price Discrimination and Spatial Competition</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Choe, Chongwoo; King, Stephen; Matsushima, Noriaki
We present a model of dynamic competition between two firms where firms gather customer information through first-period purchase. This creates asymmetric information in the second period whereby a firm knows more about its own past customers than its competitor does. We examine how the ability to offer personalized prices based on customer information affects prices and profit over the two periods. When product differentiation is exogenously fixed, asymmetric information leads to two asymmetric equilibria where one firm chooses more aggressive pricing to secure a larger first-period market share. When product differentiation is also chosen endogenously, there continue to exist two asymmetric equilibria where one firm chooses more aggressive positioning. The more aggressive firm, whether through pricing or positioning, can force the game to be played to its advantage. But both firms end up worse off compared to when they use simpler pricing strategies or commit to substantial product differentiation.</description><author>Choe, Chongwoo; King, Stephen; Matsushima, Noriaki</author><pubDate>Sat, 01 Dec 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Learning to Hire? Hiring as a Dynamic Experiential Learning Process in an Online Market for Contract Labor</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Leung, Ming D.
We know a job applicant's social category affects an employer's likelihood of hiring the applicant, but we do not know whether, or how, employers update their beliefs regarding these social categories. I portray hiring as a cognitive decision and examine how prior negative and positive hiring experiences of employees from particular countries affect an employer's subsequent likelihood of hiring applicants from those countries. I hypothesize that employer reactions will reflect loss aversion-that employers will react more strongly to negative hiring experiences than positive ones. Furthermore, I expect that the similarity of the prior job will moderate this effect. Analyses of 3.9 million applications, from freelancers worldwide, for over 290,000 jobs on an online labor market demonstrate that employers are 15% less likely (versus 8% more likely) to hire freelancers from a country following a prior negative (versus positive) experience. Prior negative experiences with similar jobs (versus dissimilar jobs) lead employers to be 82% less likely (versus 8% less likely) to hire from that country. Conversely, positive experiences with similar jobs (versus dissimilar jobs) lead employers to be 25% more likely (versus 3% more likely) to subsequently hire from that country. The consequences for switching countries, following negative experiences, are analyzed and wage differences to compensate for employer reactions, are calculated. Contributions to the hiring discrimination, impression formation, and gig-economy literatures are discussed.</description><author>Leung, Ming D.</author><pubDate>Sat, 01 Dec 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Buyer Intermediation in Supplier Finance</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Tunca, Tunay I.; Zhu, Weiming
Small suppliers often face challenges to obtain financing for their operations. Especially in developing economies, traditional financing methods can be very costly or unavailable to such suppliers. To reduce channel costs, large buyers have recently begun implementing their own financing methods that intermediate between suppliers and financing institutions. In this paper, we analyze the role and efficiency of buyer intermediation in supplier financing. Building a game-theoretical model, we show that buyer intermediated financing can significantly improve channel performance, and can simultaneously benefit both supply chain participants. Using data from a large Chinese online retailer and through structural regression estimation, we demonstrate that buyer intermediation lowers interest rates and wholesale prices, increases order fill rates, and boosts supplier borrowing. Based on counterfactual analysis on the data, we predict that the implementation of buyer intermediated financing will improve channel profits by 13.05%, increasing supplier and retailer profits by more than 10% each, and yielding approximately $44 million projected savings for the retailer.</description><author>Tunca, Tunay I.; Zhu, Weiming</author><pubDate>Sat, 01 Dec 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>The Effect of Subscription Video-on-Demand on Piracy: Evidence from a Household-Level Randomized Experiment</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>de Matos, Miguel Godinho; Ferreira, Pedro; Smith, Michael D.
We partner with a major multinational telecommunications provider to analyze the effect of subscription video-on-demand (SVoD) services on digital piracy. For a period of 45 consecutive days, a group of randomly selected households who used BitTorrent in the past were gifted with a bundle of TV channels with movies and TV shows that could be streamed as in SVoD. We find that, on average, households that received the gift increased overall TV consumption by 4.6% and reduced Internet downloads and uploads by 4.2% and 4.5%, respectively. However, and also on average, treated households did not change their likelihood of using BitTorrent during the experiment. Our findings are heterogeneous across households and are mediated by the fit between the preferences of households in our sample for movies and the content available as part of the gifted channels. Households with preferences aligned with the gifted content reduced their probability of using BitTorrent during the experiment by 18% and decreased their amount of upload traffic by 45%. We also show using simulation that the size of the SVoD catalog and licensing window restrictions limit significantly the ability of content providers to match SVoD offerings to the preferences of BitTorrent users. Finally, we estimate that households in our sample are willing to pay at most $3.25 USD per month to access a SVoD catalog as large as Netflix's in the United States. Together, our results show that, as a stand-alone strategy, using legal SVoD to curtail piracy will require, at the minimum, offering content much earlier and at much lower prices than those currently offered in the marketplace, changes that are likely to reduce industry revenue and that may damage overall incentives to produce new content while, at the same time, curbing only a small share of piracy.</description><author>de Matos, Miguel Godinho; Ferreira, Pedro; Smith, Michael D.</author><pubDate>Sat, 01 Dec 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Collusion in Bertrand vs. Cournot Competition: A Virtual Bargaining Approach</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Melkonyan, Tigran; Zeitoun, Hossam; Chater, Nick
How do firms manage to collude without communicating? Why do we find more collusion in price competition than in quantity competition? Why is collusion so hard to detect? We examine strategic behavior in competitive interactions by developing and applying the concept of virtual bargaining. When decision makers virtually bargain, they mentally simulate, and choose among, agreements that they could reach if they were able to explicitly negotiate with each other. Virtual bargainers focus on agreements that offer some protection against the possibility that their counterparts may deviate and best respond to these agreements. We develop a formal account of virtual bargaining and demonstrate that it leads to collusion in Bertrand, but not in Cournot, competition. In this framework, collusion is a result of virtual bargaining as a mode of reasoning and requires neither communication nor dynamic considerations, such as rewards and punishments, between the players.</description><author>Melkonyan, Tigran; Zeitoun, Hossam; Chater, Nick</author><pubDate>Sat, 01 Dec 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Fixed vs. Flexible Pricing in a Competitive Market</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Selcuk, Cemil; Gokpinar, Bilal
We study the selection and dynamics of two popular pricing policies-fixed price and flexible price-in competitive markets. Our paper extends previous work in marketing, for example, Desai and Purohit (2004) by focusing on decentralized markets with a dynamic and fully competitive framework while also considering possible noneconomic aspects of bargaining. We construct and analyze a competitive search model, which allows us to endogenize the expected demand depending on pricing rules and posted prices. Our analysis reveals that fixed and flexible pricing policies generally coexist in the same marketplace, and each policy comes with its own list price and customer demographics. More specifically, if customers dislike haggling, then fixed pricing emerges as the unique equilibrium, but if customers get some additional satisfaction from the bargaining process, then both policies are offered, and the unique equilibrium exhibits full segmentation: haggler customers avoid fixed-price firms and exclusively shop at flexible firms, whereas nonhaggler customers do the opposite. We also find that prices increase in customer satisfaction, implying that sellers take advantage of the positive utility enjoyed by hagglers in the form of higher prices. Finally, considering the presence of seasonal cycles in most markets, we analyze a scenario in which market demand goes through periodic ups and downs and find that equilibrium prices remain mostly stable despite significant fluctuations in demand. This finding suggests a plausible competition-based explanation for the stability of prices.</description><author>Selcuk, Cemil; Gokpinar, Bilal</author><pubDate>Sat, 01 Dec 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Pathways to Profits: The Impact of Marketing vs. Finance Skills on Business Performance</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Anderson, Stephen J.; Chandy, Rajesh; Zia, Bilal
This paper examines the impact of improvements in marketing skills relative to finance skills among small-scale entrepreneurs. It addresses three important questions: (1) What is the impact of marketing or finance skills on business profits? (2) How do improvements in marketing and finance skills respectively affect different business outcomes? (3) When are increases in marketing relative to finance skills more beneficial? Through a randomized control study of 852 firms in South Africa, the analysis finds significant improvements in profitability from both types of business skills training. However, the pathways to achieve these gains differ substantially between the two groups. The marketing group achieves greater profits by adopting a growth focus on higher sales, greater investments in stock and materials, and hiring more employees. The finance group achieves similar profit gains but through an efficiency focus on lower costs. Both groups show significantly higher adoption of business practices related to their respective training program. Consistent with a growth focus, marketing/sales skills are significantly more beneficial to businesses run by entrepreneurs with ex ante less exposure to different market contexts. In contrast and in line with an efficiency focus, it is the more established businesses that benefit significantly more from finance/accounting skills.</description><author>Anderson, Stephen J.; Chandy, Rajesh; Zia, Bilal</author><pubDate>Sat, 01 Dec 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Multidimensional Decision Making in Operations: An Experimental Investigation of Joint Pricing and Quantity Decisions</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Ramachandran, Karthik; Tereyagoglu, Necati; Xia, Yusen
Firms in several industries, such as medicine, apparel, and publishing, must jointly determine the price and production quantity of their products well in advance of the selling season. Normative prescriptions to solve this problem have generally ignored behavioral aspects of decision making while behavioral research has paid limited attention to interdependent, multidimensional decisions. We experimentally examine subjects' performance when they jointly determine price and quantities. We find that subjects systematically deviate from the theoretically optimal price and quantity levels. Contrary to expectation, decomposing the price and quantity decisions does not improve subjects' decisions. In a series of follow-up experiments, we isolate the effects of (a) interdependence between decisions and (b) demand uncertainty. We show that decisions improve by making subjects more aware of interdependence and by reducing the uncertainty. However, reducing complexity through partial automation of the interdependent dimensions does not improve the decisions made by subjects. We also find that subjects anchor on cost for price decisions and on mean demand potential for quantity decisions, thereby explaining the consistent underpricing and overordering behavior across experiments.</description><author>Ramachandran, Karthik; Tereyagoglu, Necati; Xia, Yusen</author><pubDate>Sat, 01 Dec 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Efficient Allocation and Pricing of Multifeatured Items</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Candogan, Ozan; Pekec, Sasa

Such preferences are relevant in many important practical settings, such as Internet advertising markets (where impressions have associated attributes), labor markets (where workers' skills/titles correspond to features), and long-term bond markets (where coupon payments can be associated with features). We focus on settings where features can be organized in a tree network, and features possessed by items are captured by paths on the tree. In such settings, under appropriate consistency conditions, we establish that Walrasian equilibria exist. In addition, we provide a computationally tractable price update algorithm that terminates with market-clearing prices that support an efficient outcome.</description><author>Candogan, Ozan; Pekec, Sasa</author><pubDate>Sat, 01 Dec 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Can You Gig It?

We examine how the entry of gig-economy platforms influences local entrepreneurial activity. On the one hand, such platforms may reduce entrepreneurial activity by offering stable employment for the unemployed and underemployed. On the other hand, such platforms may enable entrepreneurial activity by offering work flexibility that allows the entrepreneur to redeploy resources strategically in order to pursue the nascent venture. To resolve this tension, we examine the entry of the ridesharing platform Uber X into local areas. We use two measures of entrepreneurial activity: crowdfunding campaign launches at Kickstarter, the world's largest reward-based crowdfunding platform, and levels of self-employment from the Current Population Survey. Results indicate a negative and significant relationship between platform entry and both measures of entrepreneurial activity. Importantly, the effect manifests primarily amongst unsuccessful Kickstarter campaigns and unincorporated entrepreneurial ventures, suggesting that gig-economy platforms predominantly reduce lower quality entrepreneurial activity, seemingly by offering viable employment for the unemployed and underemployed. These relationships are corroborated with a first-hand survey conducted with gig-economy service providers.</description><author>Burtch, Gordon; Carnahan, Seth; Greenwood, Brad N.</author><pubDate>Sat, 01 Dec 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Aeromedical Battlefield Evacuation Under Endogenous Uncertainty in Casualty Delivery Times</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Lejeune, Miguel A.; Margot, Francois
We propose a new medical evacuation (MEDEVAC) model with endogenous uncertainty in the casualty delivery times. The goal is to provide timely evacuation and medical treatment to injured soldiers. The model enforces the "Golden Hour" evacuation doctrine, attempts to maximize the expected number of severely injured soldiers evacuated within one hour without delay, and represents the availability of air ambulances as an endogenous source of uncertainty. The MEDEVAC model is a mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem whose continuous relaxation is in general nonconvex and for which we develop an algorithmic method articulated around (i) new bounding techniques obtained through the solution of restriction and relaxation problems and (ii) a spatial branch-and-bound algorithm solving conic mixed-integer programs at each node. The computational study, based on data from Operation Enduring Freedom, reveals that the bounding problems can be quickly solved regardless of problem size, the bounds are tight, and the spatial branch-and-bound dominates the CPLEX and BARON solvers in terms of computational time and robustness. Compared to the MEDEVAC myopic policy, our approach increases the number of casualties treated timely and can contribute to reducing the number of deaths on the battlefield. The benefits increase as the MEDEVAC resources become tighter and the combats intensify. The model can be used at the strategic level to design an efficient MEDEVAC system and at the tactical level for intelligent tasking and dispatching.</description><author>Lejeune, Miguel A.; Margot, Francois</author><pubDate>Sat, 01 Dec 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>The Impact of E-Visits on Visit Frequencies and Patient Health: Evidence from Primary Care</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Bavafa, Hessam; Hitt, Lorin M.; Terwiesch, Christian
Secure messaging, or "e-visits," between patients and providers has sharply increased in recent years, and many hope they will help improve healthcare quality, while increasing provider capacity. Using a panel data set from a large healthcare system in the United States, we find that e-visits trigger about 6% more office visits, with mixed results on phone visits and patient health. These additional visits come at the sacrifice of new patients: physicians accept 15% fewer new patients each month following e-visit adoption. Our data set on nearly 100,000 patients spans from 2008 to 2013, which includes the rollout and diffusion of e-visits in the health system we study. Identification comes from difference-in-differences estimates leveraging variation in the timing of e-visit adoption by both patients and providers. We conduct several robustness checks, including matching analyses and an instrumental variable analysis to account for possible time-varying characteristics among patient e-visit adopters.</description><author>Bavafa, Hessam; Hitt, Lorin M.; Terwiesch, Christian</author><pubDate>Sat, 01 Dec 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Personal and Social Usage: The Origins of Active Customers and Ways to Keep Them Engaged</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Lee, Clarence; Ofek, Elie; Steenburgh, Thomas J.
We study how digital service firms can develop an active customer base, focusing on two questions. First, how does the way that customers use the service postadoption to meet their own needs (personal usage) and to interact with one another (social usage) vary across customer acquisition methods? Second, how do firm-to-customer and customer-to-customer communications promote different types of usage? We study these questions using two data sets and by developing a multivariate hierarchical Poisson hidden Markov model (HMM), which fits the data significantly better than univariate and latent class approaches. We indeed find that postadoption behavior varies depending on customer acquisition method and dynamic states. At the total usage level, in one context (an annotation and note-taking service), customers who heard about the service through search and mass-invite exhibited significantly higher usage compared to those who joined through word of mouth (WOM), whereas in another context (a cloud-based file storage service), customers who joined through WOM referrals tended to exhibit higher usage. Yet, examining how routes of adoption relate to specific types of behavior, personal versus social usages, reveals a more nuanced picture. Furthermore, in both contexts, communications postadoption influenced engagement, albeit in different ways. Firm-to-customer communications, through company posts to Twitter and blog entries, had varying effects on customer behavior and in some cases led to lower personal and/or social usage; however, customer-to-customer communications tended to increase personal-use engagement across latent states and in both data sets. The findings suggest that firms offering digital services should pay attention to how the mode of customer acquisition is related to subsequent usage intensity, accounting for both personal and social activity, and encourage customers to interact with each other postadoption.</description><author>Lee, Clarence; Ofek, Elie; Steenburgh, Thomas J.</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jun 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Outsourcing Corporate Governance: Conflicts of Interest Within the Proxy Advisory Industry</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Li, Tao
Proxy advisory firms wield large influence with voting shareholders. However, conflicts of interest may arise when an advisor sells services to both investors and issuers. Using a unique data set on voting recommendations, I find that for most types of proposals, competition from a new entrant reduces favoritism toward management by an incumbent advisor that serves both corporations and investors. The results are not driven by factors that influence the entrant's coverage decision, such as the marginal cost of new coverage or previously biased recommendations by the incumbent. Similar to other information intermediaries, biased advice by proxy advisors is shown to have real, negative consequences that allow management to enjoy greater private benefits. These results suggest conflicts of interest are a real concern in the proxy advisory industry, and increasing competition could help alleviate them.</description><author>Li, Tao</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jun 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Institutional Trading and Hedge Fund Activism</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Gantchev, Nickolay; Jotikasthira, Chotibhak
This paper investigates the role of institutional trading in the emergence of hedge fund activism-an important corporate governance mechanism. We demonstrate that institutional sales raise a firm's probability of becoming an activist target. Furthermore, by exploiting the funding circumstances of individual institutions, we establish that such effects occur through a liquidity channel, i.e., the activist camouflages his purchases among other institutions' liquidity sales. Additional evidence supports our conclusion. First, activist purchases closely track institutional sales at the daily frequency. Second, such synchronicity is stronger among targets with lower expected monitoring benefits, suggesting that gains from trading with other institutions supplement these benefits in the activist's targeting decision. Finally, we find that institutional sales accelerate the timing of a campaign at firms already followed by activists rather than attract attention to unlikely targets. Taken together, our findings offer a novel empirical perspective on the liquidity theories of activism; while activists screen firms on the basis of fundamentals, they pick specific targets at a particular time by exploiting institutional liquidity shocks.</description><author>Gantchev, Nickolay; Jotikasthira, Chotibhak</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jun 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Managing Performance Signals Through Delay: Evidence from Venture Capital</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Chakraborty, Indraneel I.; Ewens, Michael
This paper examines whether agency conflicts during venture capital (VC) fundraising impact investment behavior. Using novel investment-level decisions of VCs in the process of raising new funds, we find that venture capitalists take actions hidden from their investors-i.e., limited partners (LPs)-that delay revealing negative information about VC fund performance until after a new fund is raised. After fundraising is complete, write-offs double and reinvestments in relatively worse-off entrepreneurial firms increase. We find that these observations cannot be explained by strategic bundling of news or effort constraints due to the newly raised fund. Funds with both long and short fundraising track record exhibit this behavior and the delay is costly for fund investors (LPs). This strategic delay shows that fundraising incentives have real impacts on VC fund investment decisions, which are often difficult for LPs to observe.</description><author>Chakraborty, Indraneel I.; Ewens, Michael</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jun 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Managerial Compensation in Multidivision Firms</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Alok, Shashwat; Gopalan, Radhakrishnan
Using hand-collected data on division manager (DM) pay contracts, we document that DM pay is related to the performance of both the DM's division and the other divisions in the firm. There is substantial heterogeneity in DM pay for performance. DM pay for division performance is lower in industries with less informative accounting earnings. DM pay is more sensitive to other-division performance if the DM's division is related to the rest of the firm, if the DM's division has fewer growth opportunities, and if the DM's division receives less capital from the rest of the firm. Consistent with optimal contracting view, DMs receive greater pay for other-division performance in better-governed firms. Overall, our evidence suggests that DM compensation is structured to account for the information and agency problems in multidivision firms.</description><author>Alok, Shashwat; Gopalan, Radhakrishnan</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jun 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Analyst Information Discovery and Interpretation Roles: A Topic Modeling Approach</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Huang, Allen H.; Lehavy, Reuven; Zang, Amy Y.; Zheng, Rong
This study examines analyst information intermediary roles using a textual analysis of analyst reports and corporate disclosures. We employ a topic modeling methodology from computational linguistic research to compare the thematic content of a large sample of analyst reports issued promptly after earnings conference calls with the content of the calls themselves. We show that analysts discuss exclusive topics beyond those from conference calls and interpret topics from conference calls. In addition, we find that investors place a greater value on new information in analyst reports when managers face greater incentives to withhold value-relevant information. Analyst interpretation is particularly valuable when the processing costs of conference call information increase. Finally, we document that investors react to analyst report content that simply confirms managers' conference call discussions. Overall, our study shows that analysts play the information intermediary roles by discovering information beyond corporate disclosures and by clarifying and confirming corporate disclosures.</description><author>Huang, Allen H.; Lehavy, Reuven; Zang, Amy Y.; Zheng, Rong</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jun 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Range-Dependent Utility</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Kontek, Krzysztof; Lewandowski, Michal
First, this paper introduces and axiomatizes range-dependent utility as a new conceptual framework for decision making under risk. It is a simple and well-defined generalization of expected utility theory in which utility depends on the range of lottery outcomes. Second, a special case of this framework is proposed for prediction. It is based on applying a single utility function (decision utility) to every normalized lottery range. The resultant decision utility model predicts well-known expected utility paradoxes without recourse to probability weighting. Necessary and sufficient conditions for the model to satisfy monotonicity with respect to first-order stochastic dominance are identified. The typical decision utility function, which is confirmed by both experimental data and normative considerations, is S shaped.</description><author>Kontek, Krzysztof; Lewandowski, Michal</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jun 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>How Do Prior Gains and Losses Affect Subsequent Risk Taking? New Evidence from Individual-Level Horse Race Bets</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Suhonen, Niko; Saastamoinen, Jani
Many empirical studies focusing on how prior outcomes affect subsequent risk taking report conclusions that appear mutually contradictory. While some studies document increased risk taking after gains and risk aversion after losses, others report the opposite. This paper contributes to this literature by investigating horse race bettors' sequential risky decisions using individual-level data. A horse race betting market is a laboratory-like environment and can be used to analyze behavioral patterns associated with decision making under risk. We find evidence for (i) the "house money effect" as bettors take riskier wagers after gains and mostly spend the money they have won; (ii) risk aversion after prior losses, which we label a "playing safe effect"; and (iii) a preference for breakeven. Contrary to the widely held conception in the empirical literature, our findings suggest that the "break-even effect" does not necessarily imply an increased preference for riskier bets because bettors may seek to break even with less risky wagers.</description><author>Suhonen, Niko; Saastamoinen, Jani</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jun 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Online Auctions and Multichannel Retailing</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Kuruzovich, Jason; Etzion, Hila
The Internet enables sellers to offer products through multiple channels simultaneously. In particular, many sellers utilize online auctions in parallel to an offline channel in which they offer the item for a fixed price. Using search theory, we develop an analytical model for studying sellers' pricing decisions and auction outcomes in the context of such multichannel retailing. Our analytical model provides a framework for studying how characteristics of the demand in an offline retail sales channel impact the seller's optimal reserve price in the auction channel, the probability that an auction ends in a sale, the probability that an item is sold through the auction channel, and the auction expected sale price. We then utilize data from eBay Motors auctions and examine empirically how the quality of a sellers' retail location impacts the seller's auctions outcomes. The results of our empirical analysis match the predictions of the analytical model.</description><author>Kuruzovich, Jason; Etzion, Hila</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jun 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Competitive Intensity and Its Two-Sided Effect on the Boundaries of Firm Performance</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Montez, Joao; Ruiz-Aliseda, Francisco; Ryall, Michael D.
The new perspective emerging from strategy's value-capture stream is that the effects of competition are twofold: competition for an agent bounds its performance from below, while that for its transaction partners bounds from above. Thus, assessing the intensity of competition on either side is essential to understanding firm performance. Yet, the literature provides no formal notion of "competitive intensity" with which to make such assessments. Rather, some authors use added value as their central analytic concept, others the core. Added value is simple but misses the crucial, for-an-agent side of competition. The core is theoretically complete but difficult to interpret and empirically intractable. This paper formalizes three, increasingly general notions of competitive intensity, all of which improve on added value while avoiding the complexity of the core. We analyze markets characterized by disjoint networks of agents (e.g., supply chains), providing several insights into competition and new tools for empirical work.</description><author>Montez, Joao; Ruiz-Aliseda, Francisco; Ryall, Michael D.</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jun 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Incentives in Contests with Heterogeneous Solvers</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Koerpeoglu, Ersin; Cho, Soo-Haeng
In a contest in which solvers with heterogeneous expertise exert effort to develop solutions, a recent paper [Terwiesch C, Xu Y (2008) Innovation contests, open innovation, and multiagent problem solving. Management Sci. 54(9):1529-1543] argues that as more solvers enter the contest, every solver will reduce effort due to a lower probability of winning the contest. This paper corrects mistakes in this theory, and shows that there exist high-expertise solvers who may raise their effort in response to increased competition. This is because more entrants raise the expected best performance among other solvers, creating positive incentives for solvers to exert higher effort to win the contest. Because of this positive effect, we find that a free-entry open contest is more likely to be optimal to a contest organizer than what Terwiesch and Xu (2008) and other prior literature asserted.</description><author>Koerpeoglu, Ersin; Cho, Soo-Haeng</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jun 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Optimal Marketing Strategies for the Acquisition and Retention of Service Subscribers</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Ben Rhouma, Tarek; Zaccour, Georges
In this paper, we propose a diffusion model for a subscription service. The evolution over time of the number of subscribers is governed by a differential equation combining two processes-namely, a customer acquisition process and a customer attrition process. Assuming profit-maximization behavior of the firm, we use dynamic programming to optimize the customer equity and determine optimal customer relationship marketing expenditures. We implement an augmented Kalman filter with continuous state and discrete observations to estimate the model's parameters using market data of two well-known companies in the telecommunications sector. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to model acquisition and retention efforts in the context of a diffusion model. By doing so, we extend the literature on product diffusion to services- that is, beyond its traditional area of durable (and occasionally nondurable) products. By the same token, we contribute to the literature on customer relationship marketing (CRM), where social interactions have been overlooked. Our analytical and numerical results provide a better understanding of the relationships among the optimal customer equity, the customer lifetime value, the prospect lifetime value, and the optimal acquisition and retention spending. Our model and estimation approach give the tools for assessing empirically the role of CRM spending, social interactions, and other factors in the service subscription dynamics. Our main empirical results are as follows: (i) CRM spending and external incentives have indeed a significant effect on acquisition and retention processes; (ii) the impact of CRM is market specific; (iii) compared with optimal levels, both firms underinvest in retention; and (iv) whereas we observe increasing spending in acquisition over time, the derived optimal policy recommends a decreasing level of spending over time.</description><author>Ben Rhouma, Tarek; Zaccour, Georges</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jun 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Promoting Change from the Outside: Directing Managerial Attention in the Implementation of Environmental improvements</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Dhanorkar, Suvrat S.; Siemsen, Enno; Linderman, Kevin W.
Regulatory agencies, auditing firms, and supply chain partners externally promote change in firms. To this end, they commonly employ two different and somewhat contradictory intervention approaches. One approach uses punitive tactics to coerce firms to change, while the other approach uses supportive tactics to encourage change. Using the context of government agencies promoting environmental improvements in firms, we examine whether such punitive (e.g., regulatory inspections with possible sanctions) and supportive (e.g., environmental assistance, improvement recommendations) tactics can be administered in a complementary manner. Using a unique and novel longitudinal data set collected from two state-level environmental agencies in Minnesota, we analyze over 1,000 supportive environmental improvement (EI) projects in combination with intermittent (but currently uncoordinated) punitive tactics. One key finding from our research is that the timing, severity, and relatedness of punitive tactics is critical for directing managerial attention and thus improving the efficacy of supportive tactics (i.e., EI implementation). Contingent on their timing, inspections can increase EI implementation rates by up to 60% but can also reduce implementation rates by up to 50% compared with Els in facilities that do not experience inspections. Classifying regulatory inspections as (1) either clean or adverse and (2) either related or unrelated allows us to further explain the influence of such punitive tactics on EI implementation. Finally, we provide evidence for a positive effect of successful EI implementation on long-term environmental compliance.</description><author>Dhanorkar, Suvrat S.; Siemsen, Enno; Linderman, Kevin W.</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jun 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>The Spillover Effects of Health IT Investments on Regional Healthcare Costs</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Atasoy, Hilal; Chen, Pei-yu; Ganju, Kartik
Electronic health records (EHR) are often presumed to reduce the significant and accelerating healthcare costs in the United States. However, evidence on the relationship between EHR adoption and costs is mixed, leading to skepticism about the effectiveness of EHR in decreasing costs. We argue that simply looking at the hospital-level effects can be misleading because the benefits of EHR can go beyond the adopting hospital by creating regional spillovers via information and patient sharing. When patients move between hospitals, timely and high-quality records received at one hospital can affect the costs of care at another hospital. We provide evidence that although EHR adoption increases the costs of the adopting hospital, it has significant spillover effects by reducing the costs of neighboring hospitals. We further show that these spillovers are linked to information and patient sharing. Specifically, the spillovers are stronger when more hospitals in the region are in health information exchange networks and in the same integrated delivery systems, which can share information more easily. Furthermore, utilizing regional characteristics that can affect the extent of patient sharing such as urban versus rural areas, population density, average distance between hospitals, and hospital density, we find that locations with higher patient and hospital concentration experience stronger regional spillovers. Additionally, spillovers are stronger after the HITECH (Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health) Act that increased EHR adoption and use. Overall, our findings suggest that we need to take into account externalities to understand the benefits of health IT investments and form policy decisions.</description><author>Atasoy, Hilal; Chen, Pei-yu; Ganju, Kartik</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jun 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Competition-Based Dynamic Pricing in Online Retailing: A Methodology Validated with Field Experiments</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Fisher, Marshall; Gallino, Santiago; Li, Jun
A retailer following a competition-based dynamic-pricing strategy tracks competitors' price changes and then must answer the following questions: (i) Should we respond? (ii) If so, to whom? (iii) How much of a response? (iv) And on which products? The answers require unbiased measures of price elasticity as well as accurate estimates of competitor significance and the extent to which consumers compare prices across retailers. There are two key challenges to quantify these factors empirically: first, the endogeneity associated with almost any type of observational data, where prices are correlated with demand shocks observable to pricing managers but not to researchers, and second, the absence of competitor sales information, which prevents efficient estimation of a full consumer-choice model. We address the first issue by conducting a field experiment with randomized prices. We resolve the second issue by exploiting the retailer's own and competitors' stockouts as a source of variation to the consumer choice set, in addition to variations in competitors' prices. We estimate an empirical model capturing consumer choices among substitutable products from multiple retailers. Based on the estimates, we propose and test a best-response pricing strategy through a carefully controlled live experiment that lasts five weeks. The experiment documents an 11% revenue increase while maintaining a margin above a retailer-specified target.</description><author>Fisher, Marshall; Gallino, Santiago; Li, Jun</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jun 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Can We Trust Online Physician Ratings?

Despite heated debate about the pros and cons of online physician ratings, little systematic work has examined the correlation between physicians' online ratings and their actual medical quality. Using the ratings of cardiac surgeons at RateMDs and the patient outcomes of coronary artery bypass graft surgeries in the 2013 Florida Hospital Inpatient Discharge Data, we investigate whether online ratings are informative about physicians' medical quality. To account for potentially nonrandom matchings of patients of different severity levels to surgeons of different rating categories, we focus on patients who arrived through the emergency department and explicitly consider how observed and unobserved patient health conditions jointly affect the matching arrangements and surgical outcomes. Both reduced form and two-stage estimation results show that, compared with surgeons rated four stars or higher, or those without rating information, lower rated surgeons are associated with significantly higher in-hospital mortality rates. Our findings suggest that online physician ratings could be a valuable information source for patients to learn about physician quality, at least for cardiac surgeons, a specialty for which treatment outcomes are relatively observable to patients and their family members.</description><author>Lu, Susan F.; Rui, Huaxia</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jun 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>What Motivates Buy-Side Analysts to Share Recommendations Online?</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Crawford, Steven; Gray, Wesley; Johnson, Bryan R.; Price, Richard A.
We examine why buy-side analysts share investment ideas on SumZero.com , a private social networking website designed to facilitate interaction and information sharing among buy-side professionals. We explore labor market motivations for information sharing and document that analysts with strong incentives to build a reputation (i.e., those who did not attend a top 10 university and those employed at small funds) are significantly more likely to share recommendations. Our findings indicate that analysts who share ideas are more likely to change jobs and that the likelihood of employment change is positively related to the ratings provided by peers. We also document that analyst recommendations generate significant returns when they are posted on SumZero and that prices drift in the direction of the recommendation. Long-window returns are particularly strong for contrarian buy recommendations and for most sell recommendations. Overall, we show that buy-side analysts share valuable private information in an online social network and that this can be an effective reputation-building and job-seeking tool.</description><author>Crawford, Steven; Gray, Wesley; Johnson, Bryan R.; Price, Richard A.</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jun 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Variety and Experience: Learning and Forgetting in the Use of Surgical Devices</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Ramdas, Kamalini; Saleh, Khaled; Stern, Steven; Liu, Haiyan
We use a unique, hand-collected data set to examine learning and forgetting in hip replacement surgery as a function of a surgeon's experience with specific surgical device versions and the time between their repeat uses. We also develop a generalizable method to correct for the left censoring of device-version-specific experience variables that is a common problem in highly granular experience data, using maximum simulated likelihood estimation with simulation over unobservables conditional on observables. Even for experienced surgeons, the first use of certain device versions can result in at least a 32.4% increase in surgery duration, hurting quality and productivity. Furthermore, with the passage of time, surgeons can forget knowledge gained about the use of particular devices. For certain devices, when the time gap between repeat uses increases from its median to its 75th percentile, surgery duration increases by about 3.4%. The high productivity and quality costs associated with device variety suggest that the gain from a new device design needs to be large enough to compensate for the short-term disadvantages of starting up on a new learning curve and of increasing the chances of knowledge depreciation over time.</description><author>Ramdas, Kamalini; Saleh, Khaled; Stern, Steven; Liu, Haiyan</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jun 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Closing the Productivity Gap: Improving Worker Productivity Through Public Relative Performance Feedback and Validation of Best Practices</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Song, Hummy; Tucker, Anita L.; Murrell, Karen L.; Vinson, David R.
Public relative performance feedback (RPF) on an individual worker's productivity metrics is used in various organizations with the hopes of improving worker productivity, but its effects are not well understood. We examine whether public RPF could be leveraged to facilitate adoption of best practices in an organization by enabling the validation of best practices shared by identifiable top performers. We use data from two emergency departments, both of which shared best practices for improving productivity and one of which changed from privately to publicly disclosing RPF to physicians. The public disclosure of RPF allowed workers to identify their top-performing coworkers, which in turn enabled the identification and validation of best practices within the work group. We find that the intervention is associated with a 10.9% improvement in physician productivity. We also find evidence for a significant reduction in variation in productivity across providers, which stems from bottom-ranked workers exhibiting differentially large improvements in productivity. These effects hold without sacrificing system-level performance, service quality, or worker attrition. Our results suggest that public disclosure of RPF, along with the validation of the best practices being shared, can improve worker productivity.</description><author>Song, Hummy; Tucker, Anita L.; Murrell, Karen L.; Vinson, David R.</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jun 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Cross-Sided Liquidity Externalities</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Tham, Wing Wah; Sojli, Elvira; Skjeltorp, Johannes A.

Previous research has documented a behavioral distinction between "social risk," or risk caused by human factors, and natural risk. In particular, people tend to demand a premium on the probability of a favorable outcome in order to expose themselves to a social source of risk rather than a natural source of risk. Several explanations for what drives this social risk premium have been offered-most prominently, (i) an aversion to a counterparty's potentially malign intentions and (ii) a more general aversion to ceding control to someone with conflicting interests. We propose that a fundamental determinant of the social risk premium may relate to a counterparty's capacity to engage in intentional action. We employ a between-subjects experimental design in which we manipulate subjects' capacity for intentional action. Our design allows us to identify the component of the social risk premium related to an aversion to betrayal, independent of any aversion to ceding control. Furthermore, our results show that intentions are a crucial determinant of the social risk premium. We identify factors that eliminate, and may even change the sign of, the social risk premium. Our results contribute to our understanding of the factors that influence the perception of social risk and have implications for optimal contract design in a wide variety of situations involving social risk.</description><author>Butler, Jeffrey V.; Miller, Joshua B.</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jun 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Offline Assortment Optimization in the Presence o an Online Channel</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Dzyabura, Daria; Jagabathula, Srikanth
Firms are increasingly selling through both offline and online channels, allowing customers to experience the touch and feel of product attributes before purchasing those products. Consequently, the selection of products offered offline affects the demand in both channels. We address how firms should select an optimal offline assortment to maximize profits across both channels; we call this the showcase decision problem. We incorporate the impact of physical evaluation on preferences into the consumer demand model. Under this model, we show that the decision problem is NP-hard. Analytically, we derive optimal results for special cases and near-optimal approximations for general cases. Empirically, we use conjoint analysis to identify changes in consumer preferences resulting from physically evaluating products. For this application, we demonstrate gains in expected revenue of up to 40% due to accounting for the impact of offline assortment on the online sales.</description><author>Dzyabura, Daria; Jagabathula, Srikanth</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jun 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Price Discontinuities in an Online Market for Used Cars</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Englmaier, Florian; Schmoeller, Arno; Stowasser, Till
We study the price-setting behavior in a competitive market for used cars and provide empirical evidence for coarse information processing. Based on detailed field data from one of Europe's largest online marketplaces for automotive vehicles, we document systematic and sizable price discontinuities at salient car-age and mileage thresholds. The price difference between two otherwise identical cars across registration years (where one was first registered in January and the other in December of the previous year) is up to five times larger than that between two cars first registered in any two subsequent months within a registration year. A similar pattern can be observed in the mileage dimension at 10,000-km odometer marks, which is in line with earlier findings in the literature. Being able to study discontinuities along two dimensions of the same good allows us to further our understanding toward a more general notion of inattentive behavior. While our results are compatible with a behavioral model of limited attention, we also provide evidence for a more traditional explanation based on search frictions.</description><author>Englmaier, Florian; Schmoeller, Arno; Stowasser, Till</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jun 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>The Operational Advantages of Threshold Discounting Offers</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Marinesi, Simone; Girotra, Karan; Netessine, Serguei
We study threshold discounting, or the practice of offering a discounted-price service if at least a prespecified number of customers signal interest in it, as pioneered by Groupon. We model a capacity-constrained firm, a random-sized population of strategic customers, a desirable hot period, and a less desirable slow period. Compared to a more traditional approach (slow period discounting or closure), threshold discounting has two operational advantages. First, the contingent discount temporally balances demand when the market for the service is large, and reduces supply of the service (preserving higher margins) when the market is small, allowing the firm to respond to the service's unobserved market potential. Second, activation of the threshold discount signals the market state and the consequent service availability to strategic customers, inducing them into self-selecting the consumption period to one that improves the firm's capacity utilization. Yet, threshold discounting can be harmful in situations with chronically low demand. In contrast with past work on strategic customers, their presence is advantageous to firms in our context. A calibrated numerical study shows that threshold discounting improves firm profits over a traditional approach by as much as 33% (7% on average).</description><author>Marinesi, Simone; Girotra, Karan; Netessine, Serguei</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jun 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Contract Design by Service Providers with Private Effort</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Zhang, Hao; Kong, Guangwen; Rajagopalan, Sampath
We investigate the performance of two commonly used pricing schemes-hourly-rate contract and two-part tariff-in service environments where the buyer's valuation is invisible to the service provider and the provider's effort may not be visible to the buyer. In the private effort environment, we further distinguish between situations where the contract may be based on the outcome or on the effort reported by the provider. We show that under the two-part tariff, when effort is private, the provider can achieve the same profit as under public effort by contracting on reported effort and will be worse off by contracting on outcome. Under the hourly-rate contract, compared with the public effort case, the provider may be better or worse off in keeping effort private and contracting on the reported effort, and the trade-off is affected by the degree of outcome uncertainty in a nontrivial way. We find that a provider's profits under an hourly-rate contract are as good as under a two-part tariff over a sizable parameter regime when contracting on reported effort.</description><author>Zhang, Hao; Kong, Guangwen; Rajagopalan, Sampath</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jun 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Efficient Ignorance: Information Heterogeneity in a Queue</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Hu, Ming; Li, Yang; Wang, Jianfu
How would the growing prevalence of real-time delay information affect a service system? We consider a single-server queueing system where customers arrive according to a Poisson process and the service time follows an exponential distribution. There are two streams of customers, one informed about real-time delay and the other uninformed. The customers' uninformed behavior may be due to information ignorance or rational behavior in the presence of an information fee. We characterize the equilibrium behavior of customers with information heterogeneity and investigate how the presence of a larger fraction of informed customers affects the system performance measures, i.e., throughput and social welfare. We show that the effects of growing information prevalence on system performance measures are determined by the equilibrium joining behavior of uninformed customers. Perhaps surprisingly, we find that throughput and social welfare can be unimodal in the fraction of informed customers. In other words, some amount of information heterogeneity in the population can lead to more efficient outcomes, in terms of the system throughput or social welfare, than information homogeneity. For example, under a very mild condition, throughput in a system with an offered load of 1 will always suffer if there are more than 58% of informed customers in the population. Moreover, it is shown that for an overloaded system with offered load sufficiently higher than 1, social welfare always reaches its maximum when some fraction of customers is uninformed of the congestion level in real time.</description><author>Hu, Ming; Li, Yang; Wang, Jianfu</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jun 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>The Determinants and Impact of Executive-Firm Matches</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Pan, Yihui
I estimate a model of executive-firm matching, in which both components of the executive labor market outcome-the assignment of managers to firms and the cross-sectional distribution of executive pay-are endogenously determined. Results in this paper reveal the importance of match specificity in productivity, driven by complementarities between firm and manager attributes. Therefore, one reason that larger, more diversified, research-intensive firms pay their executives more is because they are assortatively matched with managers that are talented, have more cross-industry experience, and are prone to innovation. More important, they outbid competing firms for these managers because they enjoy higher marginal productivity from given managerial skills. Announcement abnormal returns and executive tenure duration are both higher for matches with higher estimated productivity, suggesting mutual benefits for both the firms and the managers from assortative matching.</description><author>Pan, Yihui</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jan 2017 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Old Age and the Decline in Financial Literacy</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Finke, Michael S.; Howe, John S.; Huston, Sandra J.
Households age 60 and older bear increasing responsibility for managing retirement portfolios, and they hold the majority of financial assets in the United States. Cognitive aging studies find evidence of a decline in fluid and crystallized intelligence in old age that may impact the ability to manage money effectively. Using a large sample of older respondents, we test whether knowledge of basic concepts essential to effective financial choice declines after age 60. We find a consistent linear decline in financial literacy score after age 60. A nearly identical rate of decline among men, stockowners, older, and college-educated respondents indicates that cohort effects are not driving the results. Confidence in financial decision-making abilities does not decline with age. A separate analysis using data that include measures of cognitive ability suggests that a natural decline in both fluid and crystallized intelligence in old age contributes to falling financial literacy scores.</description><author>Finke, Michael S.; Howe, John S.; Huston, Sandra J.</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jan 2017 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>The Effect of Board Directors from Countries with Different Genetic Diversity Levels on Corporate Performance</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Delis, Manthos D.; Gaganis, Chrysovalantis; Hasan, Iftekhar; Pasiouras, Fotios
We link genetic diversity in the country of origin of the firms' board members with corporate performance via board members' nationality. We hypothesize that our approach captures deep-rooted differences in cultural, institutional, social, psychological, physiological, and other traits that cannot be captured by other recently measured indices of diversity. Using a panel of firms listed in the North American and UK stock markets, we find that adding board directors from countries with different levels of genetic diversity (either higher or lower) increases firm performance. This effect prevails when we control for a number of cultural, institutional, firm-level, and board member characteristics, as well as for the nationality of the board of directors. To identify the relationship, we use-as instrumental variables for our diversity indices-the migratory distance from East Africa and the level of ultraviolet exposure in the directors' country of nationality.</description><author>Delis, Manthos D.; Gaganis, Chrysovalantis; Hasan, Iftekhar; Pasiouras, Fotios</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jan 2017 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Do Preference Reversals Disappear When We Allow for Probabilistic Choice?</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Loomes, Graham; Pogrebna, Ganna
The "preference reversal phenomenon," a systematic disparity between people's valuations and choices, poses challenges for theory and policy. Using a very general formulation of probabilistic preferences, we show that the phenomenon is not mainly due to intransitive choice. We find a high degree of regularity within choice tasks and also within valuation tasks, but the two types of tasks appear to evoke very different cognitive processes, even when the experimental environment tries to minimise differences.

This study formulates portfolio analysis in terms of stochastic dominance, relative entropy, and empirical likelihood. We define a portfolio inefficiency measure based on the divergence between given probabilities and the nearest probabilities that rationalize a given portfolio for some admissible utility function. When applied to a sample of time-series observations in a blockwise fashion, the inefficiency measure becomes a likelihood ratio statistic for testing inequality moment conditions. The limiting distribution of the test statistic is bounded by a chi-squared distribution under general sampling schemes, allowing for conservative large-sample testing. We develop a tight numerical approximation for the test statistic based on a two-stage optimization procedure and piecewise linearization techniques. A Monte Carlo simulation study of the empirical likelihood ratio test shows superior small-sample properties compared with various generalized method of moments tests. An application analyzes the efficiency of a passive stock market index in data sets from the empirical asset pricing literature.</description><author>Post, Thierry; Poti, Valerio</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jan 2017 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Fire Sales and House Prices: Evidence from Estate Sales Due to Sudden Death</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Andersen, Steffen; Nielsen, Kasper Meisner
This study investigates when forced sales of real estate turn into fire sales by using a natural experiment that allows us to separate supply and demand effects: Forced sales result from sudden death of house owners and are thus unrelated to current market conditions. We find that forced sales result in fire sale discounts. Discounts increase when the sale is urgent, market conditions are poor, and the seller is financially constrained. Overall, our study identifies when forced sales lead to fire sale discounts, and highlights that fire sales occur even in the absence of temporary demand shocks.</description><author>Andersen, Steffen; Nielsen, Kasper Meisner</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jan 2017 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>When Retailing and Las Vegas Meet: Probabilistic Free Price Promotions</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Mazar, Nina; Shampanier, Kristina; Ariely, Dan
A number of retailers offer gambling-or lottery-type price promotions with a chance to receive one's entire purchase for free. Although these retailers seem to share the intuition that probabilistic free price promotions are attractive to consumers, it is unclear how they compare to traditional sure price promotions of equal expected monetary value. We compared these two risky and sure price promotions for planned purchases across six experiments in the field and in the laboratory. Together, we found that consumers are not only more likely to purchase a product promoted with a probabilistic free discount over the same product promoted with a sure discount but that they are also likely to purchase more of it. This preference seems to be primarily due to a diminishing sensitivity to the prices. In addition, we find that the zero price effect, transaction cost, and novelty considerations are likely not implicated.</description><author>Mazar, Nina; Shampanier, Kristina; Ariely, Dan</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jan 2017 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Product Policy in Markets with Word-of-Mouth Communication</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Godes, David
We investigate the equilibrium relationship between product quality and word-of-mouth (WOM) communication. Specifically, we ask whether firms should optimally produce "better" products when consumers are more likely to exchange information. The critical moderating factor in our model is the nature of the communication and what its primary impact is. We first look at WOM that expands awareness of a product. We show that quality may either increase or decrease as WOM expands. The answer depends, in part, on the extent to which the expansion of WOM is one of scale alone or whether it also fundamentally changes the structure of communications. Next, we examine a model in which the primary impact of WOM is to help people to evaluate the utility provided by products with which they are already familiar. Our model suggests that more WOM in this context should always lead to higher-quality products. We demonstrate that the underlying driver of this result is that the elasticity of demand with respect to quality is increasing in the proportion of consumers who are informed about the product's quality. Taken together, the two models therefore suggest that the firm's optimal product-policy response to the growth in social interactions depends on both the content and the structure of the underlying conversations. Finally, we compare both WOM models to analogous models of advertising and demonstrate that the firm's optimal response to a decrease in advertising costs is quite different from that to an increase in WOM. The reason for these differences can be traced back to a fundamental distinction between advertising and WOM: although the former is optimized, the latter is far more random.</description><author>Godes, David</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jan 2017 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Gain Without Pain: The Extended Effects of a Behavioral Health Intervention</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Mochon, Daniel; Schwartz, Janet; Maroba, Josiase; Patel, Deepak; Ariely, Dan
We examine the extended effects of an incentive-based behavioral health intervention designed to improve nutrition behavior. Although the intervention successfully improved the target behavior, less is known about any spillovers, positive or negative, that impacted the program's net benefit. This novel examination presents an opportunity to advance our knowledge of this important question, particularly because many theories predict that balancing behaviors in other domains (e.g., reduced exercise) can occur. Our results show a positive and long-lasting persistence effect for the treatment group, even after the incentive was removed. Moreover, we observe no negative spillover effects into related domains such as exercise, and no negative impact on customer loyalty. These results support the use of incentive-based interventions and highlight the importance, for both theory and practice, of examining their extended effects.</description><author>Mochon, Daniel; Schwartz, Janet; Maroba, Josiase; Patel, Deepak; Ariely, Dan</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jan 2017 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Determinants and Trading Performance of Equity Deferrals by Corporate Outside Directors</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Franco, Francesca; Ittner, Christopher D.; Urcan, Oktay
This study investigates the determinants and trading performance of outside directors' equity deferrals, which represent the choice to convert part or all of their annual cash compensation into deferred company stock. Using a large sample of S&amp;P 1500 firms that allowed directors to defer their cash fees into equity between 1999 and 2009, we find significant associations between equity deferral choices and specific features of the director compensation plans, proxies for directors' outside wealth diversification, and future firm stock market performance. Trading performance analyses indicate that outside directors earn substantial abnormal returns from their deferrals, with a significant proportion of the deferral transactions occurring during blackout periods. These results are consistent with companies structuring director equity deferral plans to circumvent U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 10b-5's trading restrictions.</description><author>Franco, Francesca; Ittner, Christopher D.; Urcan, Oktay</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jan 2017 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Pricing Variation Within Dual-Distribution Chains: The Different Implications of Externalities and Signaling for High- and Low-Quality Brands</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Kalnins, Arturs
Within many of the multioutlet branded chains that dominate the retail and services landscape, the organizational form(e.g., company management, franchising) used to manage an outlet varies from site to site, as do the prices charged at those sites.

In particular, I develop logic that the relevant form of externality should differ for upper quality tier brands and lower tier brands. Using panel data on price and organizational form from more than 6,700 branded U.S. hotels affiliated with 40 "dual-distribution" brands-those brands that simultaneously company manage and franchise individual outlets-I find that, consistent with the brand externality arguments, company-managed locations have higher prices within high-quality chains, whereas franchisees price higher in the lower tiers.</description><author>Kalnins, Arturs</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jan 2017 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Evidence on the Presence of Representativeness Bias in Investor Interpretation of Consistency in Sales Growth</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Ahmed, Anwer S.; Safdar, Irfan

The selection of products and prices offered by a firm significantly impacts its profits. Existing approaches do not provide flexible models that capture the joint effect of assortment and price. We propose a nonparametric framework in which each customer is represented by a particular price threshold and a particular preference list over the alternatives. The customers follow a two-stage choice process; they consider the set of products with prices less than the threshold and choose the most preferred product from the set considered. We develop a tractable nonparametric expectation maximization (EM) algorithm to fit the model to the aggregate transaction data and design an efficient algorithm to determine the profit-maximizing combination of offer set and price. We also identify classes of pricing structures of increasing complexity, which determine the computational complexity of the estimation and decision problems. Our pricing structures are naturally expressed as business constraints, allowing a manager to trade off pricing flexibility with computational burden.</description><author>Jagabathula, Srikanth; Rusmevichientongb, Paat</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Sep 2017 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Beautiful Lemons: Adverse Selection in Durable-Goods Markets with Sorting</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Peterson, Jonathan R.; Schneider, Henry S.

We study the impact of network information for social security fraud detection. In a social security system, companies have to pay taxes to the government. This study aims to identify those companies that intentionally go bankrupt to avoid contributing their taxes. We link companies to each other through their shared resources, because some resources are the instigators of fraud. We introduce GOTCHA!, a new approach to define and extract features from a time-weighted network and to exploit and integrate network-based and intrinsic features in fraud detection. The GOTCHA! propagation algorithm diffuses fraud through the network, labeling the unknown and anticipating future fraud while simultaneously decaying the importance of past fraud. We find that domaindriven network variables have a significant impact on detecting past and future frauds and improve the baseline by detecting up to 55% additional fraudsters over time.</description><author>Van Vlasselaer, Veronique; Eliassi-Rad, Tina; Akoglu, Leman; Snoeck, Monique; Baesens, Bart</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Sep 2017 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Tail Risk Dynamics in Stock Returns: Links to the Macroeconomy and Global Markets Connectedness</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Massacci, Daniele

As public firms exploit their growth opportunities following their initial public offering, their assets in place increase, and they organize themselves optimally to operate these assets efficiently, which requires a more formal and less flexible organization than to generate new growth opportunities. Our theory predicts that, as a result of these inflexibilities, firms fail to fully replace their growth opportunities, so that their Tobin's q falls with age and they invest less as they grow older. With our theory, competition in the market for corporate control and capital markets monitoring increase the rate of decrease in Tobin's q, while product and labor market competition slow it down. We find empirical support for these predictions. We also find evidence that the decline in q is related to firm rigidities.</description><author>Loderer, Claudio; Stulz, Rene; Waelchli, Urs</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Sep 2017 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Between First- and Second-Order Stochastic Dominance</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Mueller, Alfred; Scarsini, Marco; Tsetlin, Ilia; Winkler, Robert L.
We develop a continuum of stochastic dominance rules, covering preferences from first- to second-order stochastic dominance. The motivation for such a continuum is that while decision makers have a preference for "more is better," they are mostly risk averse but cannot assert that they would dislike any risk. For example, situations with targets, aspiration levels, and local convexities in induced utility functions in sequential decision problems may lead to preferences for some risks. We relate our continuum of stochastic dominance rules to utility classes, the corresponding integral conditions, and probability transfers and discuss the usefulness of these interpretations. Several examples involving, e.g., finite-crossing cumulative distribution functions, location-scale families, and induced utility, illustrate the implementation of the framework developed here. Finally, we extend our results to a combined order including convex (risk-taking) stochastic dominance.</description><author>Mueller, Alfred; Scarsini, Marco; Tsetlin, Ilia; Winkler, Robert L.</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Sep 2017 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>A Corporate Beauty Contest</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Graham, John R.; Harvey, Campbell R.; Puri, Manju

Our experiments, studying the facial traits of CEOs using nearly 2,000 subjects, link facial characteristics to both CEO compensation and performance. In one experiment, we use pairs of photographs and find that subjects rate CEO faces as appearing more "competent" than non-CEO faces. Another experiment matches CEOs from large firms against CEOs from smaller firms and finds large-firm CEOs look more competent. In a third experiment, subjects numerically score the facial traits of CEOs. We find competent looks are priced into CEO compensation, more so than attractiveness. Our evidence suggests this premium has a behavioral origin. First, we find no evidence that the premium is associated with superior performance. Second, we separately analyze inside and outside CEO hires and find that the competence compensation premium is driven by outside hires-the situation where first impressions are likely to be more important.</description><author>Graham, John R.; Harvey, Campbell R.; Puri, Manju</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Sep 2017 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>Investor Horizon and the Life Cycle of Innovative Firms: Evidence from Venture Capital</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Barrot, Jean-Noel

The sensitivity of investment decisions to horizon is stronger among experienced venture capital firms, who allocate investments across a larger number of fund vintages. Finally, I find that the interaction of funds' fixed horizon with their option-like compensation structure affects their investment decisions: when early performance has been high, fund managers target less innovative companies.

We develop 26 questions that measure business practices in marketing, stock-keeping, record-keeping, and financial planning. These questions have been administered in surveys in Bangladesh, Chile, Ghana, Kenya, Mexico, Nigeria, and Sri Lanka. We show that variation in business practices explains as much of the variation in outcomes-sales, profits, and labor productivity and total factor productivity-in microenterprises as in larger enterprises. Panel data from three countries indicate that better business practices predict higher survival rates and faster sales growth. The association of business practices with firm outcomes is robust to including numerous measures of the owner's human capital.

Although the adoption of new technology has received significant attention in management research, investigations of abandonment have lagged. In this study, we examine differences in the rates of abandonment of medical technologies based on whether abandonment occurs in response to the emergence of a superior technology or in light of new information questioning its efficacy. We link differences in responses to underlying differences in the missions and incentives of organizations. Examining coronary stents across three technological regime changes using a census of approximately two million patients admitted to Florida hospitals from 1995 to 2007, we show meaningful differences across three hospital types: for-profit, not-for-profit, and academic medical centers. Results show that for-profit hospitals abandon the earlier generation in favor of a superior technology faster than not-for-profit hospitals, but this is not the case if the efficacy of the technology is questioned. Academic medical centers, however, have the highest rates of abandonment under both triggers. Importantly, we find that organizational factors dominate physician differences as explanatory factors for abandonment. Implications of these findings are twofold. First, we identify the factors likely at play, i.e., the salience of norms of science and the corresponding trade-offs with economic benefits, when organizations make abandonment decisions. Second, our work underscores the importance of organizational mission, which dominates individual preferences in determining rates of abandonment.</description><author>Greenwood, Brad N.; Agarwal, Ritu; Agarwal, Rajshree; Gopal, Anandasivam</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Sep 2017 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item><item><title>How Much Does Honesty Cost? Small Bonuses Can Motivate Ethical Behavior</title><link>http://www.example.com/articles/1</link><description>Wang, Long; Murnighan, J. Keith
Although people generally try to avoid lying, the lure of potential monetary payoffs often leads to unethical behavior. The current research investigates whether small monetary rewards for honesty help people resist the temptations of larger incentives or whether they backfire and lead to even more dishonesty. Four experiments address these issues. Experiment 1 shows that a $1 bonus led people to act more honestly when they could have lied to obtain $4; an identical bonus, however, did not increase dishonesty. Experiment 2 uses a different context and again shows that a $1 bonus led people to act more honestly; it also finds no evidence that this small payoff crowded out subsequent altruistic behavior. Experiment 3 shows that a $1 bonus increased people's honesty even when the payoffs for lying increased to $8, $12, and $16, but not when the payoff for lying increased to $20. Experiment 4 finds that smaller bonuses for honesty still had an impact, although it tended to be somewhat weaker. In addition, compared with no bonus, the combined effect of several small monetary bonuses (1 dollar, 75 cents, 50 cents, and 25 cents) marginally reduced lying.</description><author>Wang, Long; Murnighan, J.

We study the effects of the introduction of cross-channel functionalities on the overall sales dispersion of retailers and the implications of these effects for inventory management. To do that, we analyze data from a leading U.S. retailer who introduced a "ship-to-store" (STS) functionality that allows customers to ship products to their local store free of charge when those products are not available in their local store. Based on the fact that stores prioritize carrying products for which local demand is high, we test the hypothesis that introducing the STS functionality increased the retailer's overall sales dispersion. We find that, on average, the contribution of the 90% lowest-selling products to total sales increased by 0.75 percentage points, increasing sales dispersion. Calibrating conventional inventory-ordering models, we show that to respond optimally to the observed increase in dispersion, the retailer would need to increase its cycle and safety inventories by approximately 2.7%. Our paper points out the effect of an increasingly important retail phenomenon (channel integration) on a key factor for inventory management (sales dispersion).</description><author>Gallino, Santiago; Moreno, Antonio; Stamatopoulos, Ioannis</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Sep 2017 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.example.com/articles/1</guid></item></channel></rss>
